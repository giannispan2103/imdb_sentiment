1,tt0235472,0,"This film tells the story of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, an African-American man who rose above his troubled youth to become a top contender for the middle-weight boxing title. However, his dreams are shattered when he is accused of a triple murder, and is convicted to three natural-life terms. Despite becoming a cause celebre and his dogged efforts to prove his innocence through his autobiography, the years of fruitless efforts have left him discouraged. This changes when an African-American boy and his Canadian mentors read his book and are convinced of his innocence enough to work for his exoneration. However, what Hurricane and his friends learn is that this fight puts them against a racist establishment that profited from this travesty and have no intention of seeing it reversed.","Pretty good movie, but no true story. <br /> <br /> Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter was a notorious liar, a murder, and was never found guilty. New Jersey State has not gone a third time than 20 years. Carter got an offer in 1976: ""lie test and go free"". He did not take it. This movie should never have been done, but money speaks. Many people have unjustly spent their lives in prison and no doubt more blacks than whites. Why choose a wrong story? <br /> <br /> Jens"
1,tt0760188,0,Viennese doctor Josef Breuer meets with philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche to help him deal with his despair.,"I had to stop watching this movie (a pseudo-intellectual product for sophisticated movie viewers) for twenty minutes because it was mediocre and boring enough to inspire yawning, not to mention that I soon had tears of $ 3.99 that I had wasted on blockbuster. Joanna Pacula's drama and her terribly Slavic accent are so terrible that you can clench your teeth. I knew that two hours from her would be two hours too much. Both Breuer and Nietzsche are played by inconspicuous actors with amazingly few talents. While we look at the subject of talent, Breuer's haughty assistant emerged from a local acting troupe. She obviously did not learn her trade. In fact, she is really terrible. All the public scenes looked staged, and the extras ran around mechanically on their best Sunday. It was much more satisfying to turn off this movie than to turn it on. Do not rent this horrible movie. I'm sorry you spent your money."

I love Japanese movies, and I think another director's movie, 80,000 V electric dragon, is a masterpiece. I really wanted to like this movie - Asano is a terrific actor and the plot was very responsive. but I could not find anything entertaining about it. <br /> <br /> The movie lasts forever, until nothing happens. and the effects that the director used - such as the constant percussion and the exorbitant use of slow motion - only added to my growing annoyance over the fact that the plot was so incredibly slow and the actors exuberantly exaggerated. Much of the boredom was a series of superfluous additions that were utterly unnecessary-like an hour spent by Asano cutting Buddha statues and proclaiming that he does not worship. That did not add anything to the plot. a Japanese movie fan and I were constantly watching the time. we could not believe that this movie was as horrible as it was. and the final was awful. I thought the director would at least try to reward the viewer for making it through, but unfortunately I was wrong."

And who are they referring to, what kind of intelligence does your brain need to use to see something like this crap? This movie is for children under 3 years if you are not an adult. That's why I think Hollywood started using cartoons in movies with actors like this one. You must forget the art of cinema, be sure that you will take tons of popcorn until this movie ends Laptop your phone This movie can easily be used in a restaurant, but certainly not in a theater, my dog, always next to my family is when a movie goes out of the building.

In fact, I tend to watch something out of defiance! Bullwhip had one thing to do before the visit anyway, the fact that Rhonda Fleming and those beautiful eyes were in it immediately interested me. The picture is not very good and indeed very morally doubtful, all characters are corrupt and devious in a form or form, all motivated by greed or egocentric victories, that's all well and good, if the surrounding film can do justice to one Row of despicable people and create a tense climax picture. Unfortunately not, and since the finale fills your eyes with sugar, you can not help screaming that you've been cheated to watch a pretty bad movie, no one in the cast is coming with any acknowledgments, with Captain Guy Madison, painfully wood inside extreme case. <br /> <br /> Not even the beautiful Rhonda can make me recommend this to anyone, 3/10"
8,tt0120620,1,"Alice and Darlene, best friends, decide to take a trip to Thailand to celebrate high-school graduation. While there, they are befriended by charming Australian rogue Nick Parks. Nick convinces them to take a weekend side trip to Hong Kong, but at the airport, they are busted for smuggling drugs. They are convicted in a show trial and sentenced to 33 years; in desperation, they contact Yankee Hank, an American lawyer based in Thailand who has been reported to be helpful if you've got the cash.","We all have friends. Some of us have more than others, but there are really only one or two people you really feel connected to, people you can say are like your brother or sister. Alice (Danes) and Darlene (Beckinsale) are like that. You can see that from the beginning. They graduated, they go to parties together and they decide to go to Bangkok together, if they go to Hawaii. They are also being punished for trying to smuggle drugs into a third world country, which is a disaster. The rest of the movie is about survival and does not give up hope. It also has a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someone. <br /> <br /> Brokedown Palace is a very good movie, it's not excellent and that's because of a few issues I want to talk about. But first I want to say what's good about the movie. And for beginners, acting is first class, and you can not look further than the two leads. Danes and Beckinsale are perfect in the roles they have. Alice is always fiery and looks a bit rough on the edges, but she seems to have more fun than Darlene. But sometimes this fun can get them into trouble. Darlene is always a bit conservative, and although that can sometimes be irritating, it would have served the two girls better if they had kept their own way instead of Alice. Bill Pullman is sufficient as the Thai-based American lawyer. The film is also very well photographed. While the interior of the prison is not the same as Shawshank or Natural Born Killers or Return to Paradice, it does show the necessary (but underdeveloped) hopelessness of the situation in which they find themselves. Johnathin Kaplan's guidance is also pretty good. We see the two girls struggling to get through each day, but you can see their minds are being exposed a little bit more each day. Brokedown Palace is excellent when it comes to friendship and shows that they need to rely on each other to survive. The other thing I had to comment on is the soundtrack for the movie. It enhances and complements the mood of the film to perfection. The song you hear in the trailer is also played in the movie and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this jail. You can feel how alone they need to feel and how desperate they are to come out and return to the simple things in life. And it also makes you see yourself and realize how happy we are to live in the society we do. We have it easy compared to some countries and believe that music is a perfect catalyst for reflection on the subject. Part of the music is made by a group called delirium (I think), but it's Sara McLaughlin (misspelling, but how do you spell her last name?), Who plays the lyrics and her voice is beautiful and haunting and she adds so much in addition to the movie. <br /> <br /> What I did not like about the movie was the stupidity the girls are showing. I will not say what it is, but if you see it yourself you will know what I am talking about. Besides, I did not really feel that the prison they were in was so bad. It looked more like a minimum security prison, and that may be because in similar situations in other films where men spend time in a foreign country, the prison scenes are always brutal and sadistic. But I did not understand that here. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is a great movie and it really makes you ask, ""How far would you go for a friend?"" This is a difficult question and maybe one that none of us could honestly answer until it got into the same situation. Let's just hope it never matters."
4,tt0029146,0,"Fictionalized account of the life of famed French author Emile Zola. As portrayed in the film, he was a penniless writer sharing an apartment in Paris with painter Paul Cezanne when he finally wrote a best-seller, Nana. He has always had difficulty holding onto a job as he is quite outspoken, being warned on several occasions by the public prosecutor that he risks charges if he does not temper his writings. The bulk of the film deals with his involvement in the case of Captain Alfred Dreyfus who was falsely convicted of giving secret military information to the Germans and sentenced to life imprisonment on Devils Island. Antisemitism played an important role in the real-life case but is hardly mentioned in the film. Even after the military found definitive evidence that Dreyfus was innocent, the army decided to cover it up rather than face the scandal of having arbitrarily convicted the wrong man. Zola's famous letter, J'Accuse (I Accuse), led to his own trial for libel where he was ...","A thank you to the patience of Paul Muni, who spent hours each day in the make-up room to take over the role of Zola. Muni was one of the biggest stars of the 1930s and I wonder how many people today - except the classic movie fans - know about it. He was a giant in the industry for at least a decade. He could have won the Oscar for this performance, which would have given him two in a row when he won it the year before for Louis Pasteur. My own opinion is that although he tended to exaggerate a bit, he still thought he was one of the great actors of the ""Golden Age"". Whatever he played; You were tied to the screen and watching him. <br /> <br /> In contrast to the Pasteur role, I thought that this story is a bit too much of what we have seen in the last 60 years: go overboard to become a Liberal hero. Even in 1937, Hollywood could not suppress its contempt for the police or the military, so it was important to tell us how corrupt these organizations are. Filmmakers simply love when authority is challenged and defeated. In this regard, this film is way ahead of its time since we saw this great time since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> It should be noted, however, that the facts support this story. It also does not diminish Zola's achievements as a social reformer by eliminating certain evils. Good for him! I wish they had spent more time showing that than concentrating on an attempt."

But on the way to the crime scene, he crashes his car and gets really damaged. He does not remember what happens and the next day his life is not the same when he finds out he has animal instincts. Of course, we have our wife, our main character trying to achieve, but his attempts are useless. She is played by Collen Haskell. There are no negative signs. The negative character is fate if I could use this metaphor. Marvin should find out how to become a normal person again. By the way, his animal instinct helps him in some situations. Schneider's performance is a so-so. The movie is so unreal that at times it gets stupid, but it's one of those movies called brainless fun, as I wrote above. So look at the monkey style Rob Schneider, but it's definitely not one of the best comedies of all time or one of the best movies in which Schneider performs. He's a great comedian, but that's not his best movie."

Isolated from the local females due to jealousy and separated from her fellow dancers by gender, the ambitious dancer is subsequently kicked-off the team for showing off during a preliminary competition. Now, if Raya has any hope of realizing her medical school dreams, she will have to either earn back Bishop's trust or organize her own dance crew and start over from scratch. In the end, she eventually learns ""how she move"".","I was a bit scared to see this movie because of its prices. But in Italy, such titles never live and I love the step so much that I decided to give it a try. And how surprised I was! The story is different from any other dance movie I've seen lately, with a deeper meaning than just ""winning."" It is touching and well written and well directed. Raya is such a strong character, I love the fact that she never doubts herself, she's so mature and focused and AWARE from her talent (and what talent does Rutina Wesley have, my jaw dropped in the recent dance scene). The way she pursues her dream and refuses to let anything stop her is, frankly, inspiring. Also the fact that she is not the typical super-hot chick (see Jessica Alba, Briana Evigan, Jenna Dewan, Zoe Seldana ...) makes her really appealing and real. Seriously, why is this movie rated so low? You can understand between the first 5 minutes that it is a good job. Really good. I even cried at the end of the movie.

Their friendship ripens into love, but he conceals his past from her. Then in a remote oasis, they meet a man who knows his secret.","""The Garden of Allah"" is a prime example of ""popular women's literature,"" a turn of the twentieth-century style that combines the power of unrestrained erotic and exotic reveries with the stimulating glamor of false mysticism and the sado-masochistic bite of Catholic guilt. Just as Jane Eyre could not really be happy until her castle burned around her and her lover was permanently maimed for his sins or the heroine of ""Rebecca"" could not find true fulfillment in her marriage until her husband was put on trial The murder of his first wife (and her castle burned around her), or the poor psyche could not leave well enough and had to get Amor's secret out at any cost, Domini, the devout Catholic heroine of this tripe, can only achieve true sexual realization by unintentionally marrying a man who has renounced his holy religious vows. Like all these narratives, which are meant to incite the female reader and stimulate the vapors, it relies on the oldest tricks in the book: basic misunderstandings and the inability to express one's true feelings in the right place and time until it is too late. The logic is that any ultimate sexual ecstasy can be put down as long as one is willing to pay a high price for the atonement in the final act. It is Paul Claudel reduced to standards of the beauty salon magazine. Well ... It could have been a lot worse and it was often ... <br /> <br /> Without the religious overtones, the plot of the movie is that of your basic porn strip: Oversexed monk, crazy by abstinence is driven, the desert escapes, in which he has a few buns in the dunes with a romantic, well-formed, but naive Catholic heiress, before reintegrating his monastery, the whole passion has left out and they had their disorder cleared up. And I'm really annoyed at comparing another commentator with Anatole Frances ""Thais,"" a nifty novel whose purpose it was to ridicule the whole concept of Catholic sexual repression, some of which happily appeared in Massenet's opera of the same name. <br /> <br /> But what makes this image unique in the annals of commercial female eroticism is, of course, the enormous constellation of talents gathered under a banner to make this cinematic, wet dream a dazzling, vibrant life bring. Constant Technicolor photography that will outlive us all, a truckload of worthy character actors (including a sweet dog), a music score by Max Steiner, determined to accomplish Michael Powell's ""composed film"" (ironically playing a minor role) in the silent version of 1927) always dreamed of giggling sometimes at the edge of dissonance, but always getting through in magnificent symphonic, operatic exoticism, a dream-like atmosphere in which material considerations play no role, characters magically traveling from one place to the next the dialogue is sparse, vague and suggestive, the art direction is close to the celestial, floral arrangements appear in the humblest hut or tent, the heroine's wardrobe is inexhaustible and all male characters are either aristocrats, saints, damned sinners, mystics or poets , <br /> <br /> Ahh ... Hollywood! The MGM DVD presentation of this film is blunt, but impeccable. The bitrate is very high throughout, the color registration is almost always perfect and the 2.0 mono sound complies with Max Steiner's score and Boyer's penultimate confession. <br /> <br /> A historical note on this type of ""women's theme"": The following year (1937), Julien Duvivier, visibly inspired by ""The Garden of Allah,"" directed ""Carnet de Bal"" where a very similar clothes-horse butter-does not melt in the mouth The heroine (widowed after the care of a sick man in the exotic seclusion of an incredibly romantic alpine villa on the lake) wants to find out what she has missed by writing in her first dance book She finds them all in good time, only to realize that every feeling that was between her and her was either misunderstood, overrated or had tragic consequences - it was Duvivier's cynical way of telling us to be on our guard impossible to guard idealistic ideas and we all have to grow up sooner or later."

Honestly ?? Why should we care? Every single movie in the Zombi ""series"" delivers a lot of fun, evil gore and unnecessary shocks, and ""Zombi 3"" is no exception, despite all the production difficulties during the shoot. This film started off as an interesting Lucio Fulci project that needed to further develop its ""Zombi 2"" success, but it ended up being a typical Bruno Mattei product with more errors and stolen ideas from previous films. The script is hopelessly awkward and ignores all forms of continuity, every ingenious idea from George A. Romero's ""Night of the Living Dead"" and ""The Crazies"" is shamelessly repeated here and the theatrical performances are truly miserable and painful to watch. But all that did not bother me for a moment because the exaggerated, exaggerated blood compensated for everything! On a secret military base in the Philippines, scientists have completed the bacterial war fever virus ""Death One"" and prepared it for transport. After a failed attempt to steal the virus, the infested corpse of a terrorist is cremated and the zombie ashes contaminate the entire population of a nearby tourist destination. The last group of survivors must fight hyperactive and inhumanly strong zombies as well as soldiers in white overalls who have been instructed to kill anything that moves in the contaminated area. This movie is comparable to Umberto Lenzi's ""Nightmare City"". Really bad ... but incredibly entertaining with fast action sequences and several very creative zombie insanity situations. For example, the undead birds were original, and the whole zombie birth sequence in the abandoned hospital was pretty cool. The notorious flying-head scene is nowhere near as horrible as it was invented, and it's a perfect match for this cheesy and thoroughly enjoyable Italian zombie streak.

This would seem to be a boon for mankind, but the established garment manufacturers don't see it that way; they try to suppress it.","THE MAN IN THE WHITE ACTION, as if I were ALL RIGHT JACK, takes a weak look at work and capital. Alec Guinness is a scientific genius - but an eccentric one (he never graduated from a ... um ... accident in a college lab). He succeeds in pushing into various industrial laboratories in the textile industry. When the movie starts, he is in the company of Michael Gough, and Gough (in a memorable moment) tries to impress his would-be father-in-law (Cecil Parker) by showing him the shipform company he runs. While having lunch with Parker and Parker's daughter (Joan Greenwood), Gough gets a message regarding some issues about the lab's unexpectedly big budget problems. He reads the huge expenses (because of Guinness's experiments) and chokes on his coffee. <br /> <br /> Guinness continues to work for Parker's company, repeating the same tricks he did with Gough - but Parker discovers it too. Greenwood has discovered what Guinness is working on and persuades Parker to continue the experiments (but now legally). The result: Guinness and his assistant have apparently figured out how to make an artificial fiber that can constantly alter the electronic bonds within their molecular structure so that (in every way) the fiber stays intact forever. Any textile made from it will never fade, get dirty or wear out - it will last forever. <br /> <br /> Guinness has support from a female trust, but not from her boss. He sees Guinness as a clearance sale to the rich. But when he explains what he has done, they turn against him. If everyone has clothes that last forever, he does not need new clothes! Soon, Parkers' textile tycoons (led by Gough, Ernest Theisinger - in a wonderful performance, and Howard Marion-Crawford) are all equally panicked, which could end their dealings. They try to suppress the invention. With only Greenwood in his corner (though Parker somehow sympathizes with him), Guinness tries to bring the news of his discovery to the public. <br /> <br /> In the end, Guinness is defeated by both science and greed. But he finishes the movie because he sees the mistake in his calculations, and we suspect that one day he might even go through his discovery. <br /> <br /> It's a brilliant comedy. But is the argument for oppression valid? At one point, the difficulties in making the fabric are shown (you need to heat the threads to a high temperature to actually join the ends of the material.) There is nothing that shows that the cloth stretches when the owner gets fat ( or contract if the owner gets thin.) Should we believe that people just want one set of clothes forever? What happened to fashion changes and new styles? And the cloth is made only in the color white (Guinness looks like a white from Ritter) We are told that color staining would have to be added sooner, would not that be due to the chemical reactions that sustain the structure of the fabric? <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, that's not the case of a scientific paper, though a film about the hypocrisy of work and capital in modern industry, as such it is brilliant, but these questions, which I mention, constantly bother me about the validity of the oppression of Guinness invention"

But in this movie his acting was not convincing enough, it was pretty bad and there was no chemistry between the rest of the team. Besides, his eyes seem empty, as if he did not feel it. It really surprised me because he was good at Band of Brothers. <br /> <br /> Anyway, do not even look at this movie. It's a big, big waste of time. Even if you have to kill an hour or two, you should do something other than watch this movie. Trust me, you will regret it!"

But when Sullivan meets a mysterious woman he begins to realize that his job may not be what it seems, as he descends into a dark underworld of brainwashing and struggles to maintain his own identity.","Cypher is a movie you should have seen because it is not the usual sci-fi movie. The artistic approach is painted with dark scenes and a kind of macro-view of what is going on. The close-up of the camera shows the director holding the plot illusory. The science-fiction aspect of the film is secondary to the plot of the film. The technology used in the film is not overly impressive, but the director uses the props well. <br /> <br /> The character development is deliberately flat. The main character, Jeremy Northam, decides to delve into the world of espionage.

Visually intriguing, the film has a fluid progression of flash-backs and flash-forwards centering on the fictional Einstein's current observations, childhood memories and apprehensions for the future.","Nicolas Roeg's projects are, to say the least, variable, but no less interesting. ""Insignificance"" is obviously first and foremost an adapted set design: it is literally and quite ""space bound"". BUT, it pays to see this movie more than once: the underlying themes are not exposed, and it takes a while to adapt to the juxtaposition and role reversal of the four protagonists: Einstein, McCarthy, Munroe and DiMaggio. <br /> <br /> Einstein is plagued by guilt over Hiroshima, but he believes the simplicity of a sexual connection with Munro; Munro is tired of being seen as a Bimbo and longs for intellectual credibility; Senator McCarthy is at the height of his witch hunt, but he is an impotent parasite; DiMaggio is uncertain about his fame, self obsessed and vulnerable to violence. Each of them contains the seeds of their own destruction. Every character has a troubled, abused past and a questionable future. Gradually, we see that obsession itself is the central theme. America's obsession with its cultural icons and customs of the postwar period; the obsessions of the protagonists for something that no one can have: peace and / or happiness. <br /> <br /> Compared to the Theory of Relativity, a proposed unit field theory, and even the cosmos itself, all efforts and interactions of Roeg's protagonists seem insignificant. But these aspects of the physical universe (it's all quantum, trust me!) Influence us when they are applied to the development of the means to destroy us. Monroe's mention of the principle behind the neutron bomb (without calling it as such) is not an anachronism per se, but can only be understood by a contemporary public. In fact, ALL references within the script are only accessible to a knowledgeable observer: an author with '50s events / personality cults and how they affect us in the 21st century. <br /> <br /> This film and its script are either very, very smart or extremely opaque and pretentious. Ultimately, however, probably insignificant. <br /> <br /> live long and thrive :) <br /> <br />"

Brenda Blethyn is a good actress and does a great job in portraying widow Grace, who grows on marijuana to pay off her massive debts. The supporting role also does a good job. French actor Tchecky Karyo has a funny little role. The premise alone is appealing. The idea that a woman would grow and smoke over the mountain sounds funny enough. And the film sometimes plays with the premise. Of course, there are shallow moments, like one in which two older women hold Grace's tea leaf marijuana leaves and start making childish antics in the shop where they work. That was a mindless gag that did not really stand out. The sound of the film is dejected and sometimes boring, but I laughed enough to give this English import a recommendation. <br /> <br /> My result: 7 (out of 10)"

His knowledge of racism is STAFFISH, and impresses me on more than one level. Allegations that Lee is really just a sneaky little racist, a venomous dwarf who exploits Hollywood's affirmative action system opportunistically to produce lesser-quality films is utter nonsense, sheer right-wing extremism. The notion that Lee is abusing the current climate of political correctness in America to produce hateful, anti-white films is simply WRONG and vicious. <br /> <br /> Some of Lee's critics even go so far as to claim that the GOTB glorifies African-Americans while laying down other races: apparently, another FALSE is being spread by people fighting against peaceful coexistence between different races in America and Africa are elsewhere. <br /> <br /> My favorite scene in The Movie is a long dialogue between the rich black republicans and the others on the bus.

He SUSPENS the training, in contrast to the brilliant INFORMED guys who throw him EARLY off the bus. <br /> <br /> TERRIFIC performances and an INTELLIGENT script provide a viewing experience that competes with the political films that have since been made by RENIG. <br /> <br /> I also want to point out the incessant LIE that the Million-Man March had only 80,000 people! <br /> <br /> (And now you just have to take the antonyms of all capitalized words ...) <br /> <br /> What message is Lee sending here? If someone disagrees with your political views, use force and throw him off the bus.

It is one thing to document that the Koran says many things about how a pious Muslim has to interact with non-Muslims, but any realist can realize that not every person who feels he or she is a follower of Islam agrees with all the principles to this belief and system and follow it. There is reason to question much about the moderators so that viewers must view the presentation with a healthy skepticism; Do not swallow everything, hake, line, and sinker without thinking of anything. <br /> <br /> A specific, for example, explores the person Walid Shoebat; who claims to be a former Muslim who committed a terrorist attack in Bethlehem. There are many ways in the world that believe none of these allegations. I am not yet I was Muslim. I never read the Koran. I am not a Christian, nor a member of any faith. But I am an intelligent and demanding person. While the film is quite disturbing in its depiction, how some Muslims see their commitment to Islam; I remind you that Islam is more than the views of the fundamentalists. Just as fundamentalists and evangelical Christians are, there are differences in the intensity of faith and commitment among Jews and Muslims. <br /> <br /> If you see this movie, you have to turn on the salt shaker hand.

A cool call center executive Jimmy Cliff (Saif Ali Khan), a desi wannabe gangster Bachchan Pande (Akshay Kumar) add for good measure a beautiful girl Pooja (Kareena Kapoor) who cant be trusted - on a journey across spectacular India - a journey which will alter the course of their lives in more ways than one - a journey where even enemies need to trust each other if they want to stay alive. Trouble is, in this world no one can be trusted ever. And to top it all there is the evil eye of Bhaiyyaji (Anil Kapoor - Slumdog Millionaire and 24), maverick gangster who enjoys killing people as much as he enjoys learning to speak English.","The sight of Kareena Kapoor in a two piece bikini is the only thing that wakes you up while watching Tashan ?? the mega-disappointing, startling new movie in theaters this weekend. Bad movies are bad movies and we see them every week, but Tashan is not just a bad movie, it's a horrible movie. Terrible, because it takes its audience for granted, also because the filmmakers expect to get away without a conspiracy or common sense just because they have big movie stars on board. Written and directed by Vijay Krishna Acharya, Tashan is what you would describe as a road movie, but one that goes in the wrong directions. Saif Ali Khan plays the lead role in Jimmy Cliff, a call center manager who teaches English to Bhaiyyaji - this is Anil Kapoor, who plays an ambitious UP gangster who desperately wants to be cool. Jimmy keeps an eye out for Pooja, the gangster's pretty young assistant (played by Kareena Kapoor), who uses Jimmy to cheat her boss of 25 crore rupees. Determined to regain his money and punish both Jimmy and Pooja, Bhaiyyaji recruits his most trusted henchman to complete the job. So you have Akshay Kumar as Bachchan Pandey, the gangster loyalist from Kanpur, who tracks down the culprits and recovers the stolen money that is scattered all over the country. Like those awful eighties, Tashan is also held together by them, a threadbare script centered on a vendetta plot. But the treatment is so over-the-top, so forgiving that it can not connect. Instead of a coherent script or a traditional three-axis structure, you'll get a handful of phrases around which most of the scenes are laid out loosely. This shrill thing in the desert, the action scene in a Rajasthani fort, Kareeena's bikini moment, even this ridiculous climate-action scene with Shaolin monks, a water motorcycle racing through a filthy Naala and whether you believe it or not not a Dhanna-style horse Tonga. To be fair, not all of these set pieces are done badly - the item song in the desert is actually quite neat - but very little of it makes sense in the larger picture, because one can easily go from one piece to another using the script really. Little expected in a seemingly rapid road movie to find a disgusting sentimental flashback track about childhood love. One sees the problem with Tashan that no one is familiar with this movie, which movie they made. What's more, I do not think they did care - the movie stinks of arrogance. Arbitrarily, they pack up elements from every genre without really stopping and seeing if the mix works, Tashan is like a stew stew.There are movies that kill you quietly, and then there's Tashan, a movie that puts you through excess kills. Packed in dazzling camerawork, exotic locations, and fancy costumes, each frame of the movie probably costs a couple of lakhs together, but in the end, it still feels like a hollow, because the story does not last. Getting the Tarantino tale and the style of Stephen Chow does not help, either, because they do not merge with the gossamer action of the film. You could have complained a little less about it if the characters were more appealing, but Anil Kapoor's annoying Hinglish dialogue lets you cut your wrists, and Saif Ali Khan gropes his way silly through the movie, unable to find his feet. Kareena Kapoor, now queen of exaggerated delivery, is doing a decent job. But if Tashan is saved to some degree, it is of course thanks to Akshay Kumar's irresistible presence and spontaneous approach to the character. You're upset when he cries out in the crotch, and you look scowling as he delivers those ambiguous dialogues, but for a moment you can not take your eyes off the screen when he's up there. Despite good music by Vishal-Shekhar, the songs seem like they only prolong your misery. Well, Tashan is a test of your patience. If you did not know, Tashan means style. I'm sorry to say this movie has none."

But what we have are two completely different stories and two completely different women, both played by Radha Mitchell. <br /> <br /> The two playwrights in the opening scene - the comedian and the tragedian - supposedly take the same premise and go from there, but the two stories are only tenaciously related.

Hollywood's sword and sandal epics usually have a Christian theme, which makes it difficult to go back to earlier Roman history (Spartacus was probably the first exception to this rule and met with resistance in Hollywood because Jesus was not in it) /> <br /> It is interesting to see at least one image that takes place not only before the time of Caesar and Christ, but also when Rome was just one city among many on the Italian peninsula and had just ousted the hated King Tarquin and formed the Republic , <br /> <br /> But this is not a historical movie; it's peplum, and while production values ​​are not ground, the acting and characterizations are cardboard. I can only imagine what the dialogue was in Italian, but with the wooden English dubbing it is very cheesy. I made some good laughs out of it first. <br /> <br /> I have not seen many movies of this genre since I missed most of the 60's Hercules movies.

When it finally came to an end, I had fallen so low in my chair that I looked a bit like Stephen Hawking. The most annoying parts of the film are (a) The girl who is obviously there to give children someone to identify with. She wears the same clothes throughout the movie (one year) and shows exactly two facial expressions: joy and sincerity. She is cute, no question. A film about the beauty of nature, like this one, would have gone better without its all too human presence. I was constantly hoping that she could be eaten by a bear, drowned in the river, or become similarly terrible. (b) The commentary on the girl's adult voice telling us nothing but negligible, obvious, boring, superfluous things. (c) The music that is desperately subtle. When the girl jumps around happily, the music jumps around too. If the fox is threatened by an eagle, the music also becomes threatening. It reminded me of the early days of filmmaking and was just too predictable. Granted, many of the kids who watched the movie with me obviously liked it, at least they got involved somehow. Therefore, my warning only applies to adults: If you are over ten years old, avoid this movie. You can get better (and cheaper) sleep in most other places."

Leon becomes obsessed to find what happened with the stranger and he watches the subway station. When he sees the elegant butcher Mahogany in the train, Leon believes he might be a murderer and stalks him everywhere, in the beginning of his journey to the darkness.","I've heard and read many eulogies about ""Midnight Meat Train"" based on a short story by no less than Clive Barker and supposedly the best adaptation of his work since the original ""Hellraiser"" he directed himself, but so far I can only do a lot to express mixed feelings about my visual experience. The best term to put the whole movie into words is: disgusting! The violence is sadistic and extreme, which undoubtedly attracts fanatical young horror fans, but it's also indescribable and exploitative. Normally, I'm very pro-violent, but it has to serve at least some purpose. The butcher ?? literally? ""Midnight Meat Train"" is designed solely to shock and knock back viewers with weak nervous systems and easily cause stomach discomfort, and even this is not fully effective due to the use of digital computer effects. There are more imperfections, some even bigger than the pointless blood, but maybe I should focus on the good elements first. The basic concept is definitely promising and several sequences (such as the Chase in the freezer) literally swell with nerve-racking tension and macabre atmosphere. Unfortunately, the timing is very uneven and the elaboration of the potentially fantastic plot is unnecessarily complicated. Probably processing a short story into a long feature film scenario is responsible for the timing irregularities, but I really think they could have done more with the resolution as well as the character of Vinnie Jones. The plot introduces Leon, an aspiring photographer in New York whose agent advises to search through sinister images for the truly threatening face of the city. Leon then becomes obsessed with stalking an introverted and suspicious butcher who always awaits the midnight train. Leon is right, because the butcher turns out to be a relentless serial killer who literally smashes his victims with a big hammer, but the murderer's motivation and behavior suggests that something much more important is running on the rails at night. ""Midnight Meat Train"" takes place in naturally disturbing locations such as subway stations at night and animal slaughterhouses, but the film also benefits from good acting performances and a truckload of downright disturbing images (such as carcass on meat hook and blood smeared train wagons) Director Ryûhei Kitamura (""Versus"", ""Godzilla Final Wars"") does not exploit everything. The ending leaves a lot of questions unanswered and, even if Clive Barker would think so, I still think we deserved a slightly more conclusive finale. ""Midnight Meat Train"" is a somewhat intriguing and definitely haunting film, but not without specifications. It is not intended for slightly offended viewers, but maybe people looking for coherence and clarity should leave it alone."

The three decide to take a weekend trip into the woods to escape the stress of their lives and relax for a few days.

With Barricade Timo Rose tries to give the well-worn routine a Teutonic twist by transplanting the plot to the Black Forest and giving her the German low-budget splatter treatment. The result is a very bloody but totally unoriginal effort that is made almost unimaginable thanks to some terrible directing decisions - especially the incessant use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques. <br /> <br /> Had Timo Rose decided not to use every trick his editing software offered, and then perhaps Barricade had been a pretty entertaining Glefest: his inexperienced troupe was doing reasonably well. the bloody effects are suitably gastric vertebrae; and there are a scare or two and even some well thought out scary moments. However, all of this is completely destroyed by the terrible camera work, the restless editing and the overwhelming flood of visual gimmicks that give the film the desperate look that is so inexplicably popular with today's filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I'm giving Barricade 3 out of 10 for the weird Gore, which has a nifty scene where a guy needs to drink acid, lots of nasty wounds caused by a lot of spicy gadgets, and some pretty proper shotgun damage."

Ram Gopal Varma manages to take a crucible of talent and create a dish so stale that you can smell it from afar. Taking a classic like Sholay and murdering is totally unforgivable and I can not believe he almost called the movie RGV ki Sholay. Although Sholay contained many folklore elements, the film managed to build on its plot by defining the characters so clearly that they lived on forever. What Aag does is take those characters and confuse them so much that we need a fight to find the worst. The realism element is completely missing and what the film ultimately delivers is a group of ""actors"" parading in a less and seemingly unrelated set of events. A star for this film is a ridiculous waste of a voice. it is time for RGV to become aware of the reality of its failure and conjure up another ""other"" action that can be classified under the cinema."
8,tt0082116,1,"In 1692, a young girl in Salem, Massachusetts accuses several residents of being witches, and they are burned at the stake. In 1980, a young woman who is a descendant of the accuser finds herself having recurring nightmares about the incident and comes to believe she is being terrorized by the ghost of the father of the women who were burned as witches.","On the seemingly endless search for well-made, well-played horror films, it's rarely possible to find one that even comes close to the goal. Needless to say, I was very pleasantly surprised when I came across ""Burned at the Stake"" on a US cable network while leafing through channels. The premise is relatively simple. In 1692, the young Ann Putnam (Swift) is the loudest witness against alleged witches and drives away gratuitous charges against anyone who deserves their displeasure. It is manipulated by Reverend Parris (Peters), who also acts as a court leader in matters of witchcraft and Satanism. Things get complicated when Ann starts accusing members of the Goode family of witchcraft. Salem (from 1980 or so), Loreen Graham (also played by Swift) begins unusual visions just before she visits the Salem Witch Museum. A stranger in a 17th-century robe tries to receive her there and the building. He continues to pursue them, while strange phenomena increasingly involve them. Soon it seems that she is obsessed by Ann Putnam's spirit. Unfortunately, another description is more involved and would betray too much. Although the film is not action-oriented and is probably of little interest to many viewers, the performances are good and the seventeenth-century dialogue in the many flashbacks of the film sounds very convincing. The production values ​​are solid except for some special effects. By the way, the film's technical advisor was Laurie Cabot, Salem's official witch. Spectators who appreciate a well-made, atmospheric, yet unobtrusive horror movie may appreciate this. Author / director Bert I. Gordon has a long career in horror and science fiction filmmaking and is best known for his work on a series of big bug films and related works."

It's full of humorous characters and interesting situations, starting with the cheerful, innocent Pecker (played by Edward Furlong), who photographs almost everything he sees in daily life. Other great characters include Pecker's friend Matt (""he's a thief, but he's really a nice guy""), Pecker's sister Chrissy (who's addicted to sugar) and Pecker's Catholic grandmother, who lives in a statue of the Virgin Mary in her Room discovered. <br /> <br /> The film delicately depicts how daily life has many riches to offer and manages to emphasize this point without making too much of a fuss. There is always the danger of spreading messages about the value and dignity of the ""common people"" to slip into a kind of inverted ""holier than you"" - but ""Pecker"" avoids these traps and allows the audience to understand the point while allowing Enough scope for viewers to compare this message with their own thoughts on the subject. <br /> <br /> I recommend the movie especially because it's a lot of fun."

It's the first of Robert Culps four appearances (three as murderers) playing the same role in every show. <br /> <br /> In this case, plays Culp Brimmer, the head of a large detective company, which is asked to investigate whether the wife of the affluent newspaper magnate Kennicut has an affair. Although she is, Brimmer decides not to tell Kennicut in the hope that he can extort his wife in return for information about her husband's business partners. She reacts badly to this suggestion, it comes to a dispute, which quickly becomes violent when Brimmer slaps her face. Because he wears a big ring, the blow hits her and kills her. <br /> <br /> There are some truly priceless moments in this episode. One of my favorite scenes is where Columbo pretends to read the palm of his hand, though this is indeed a trick to discover the shape and size of Brimmers Ring, without admitting that he knows the killer wore a ring. Since Columbo is Columbo, he only reveals what he really knows when it's time to turn the screws a bit. At first he plays goofy the role of a rather simple-minded man, who is excited by the ""life-line that goes over the moon-hill,"" or an equally ridiculous, palm-reading hocus-pocus. <br /> <br /> Another A great scene is when Brimmer tries to offer Columbo a job for his company and has bribed him to stop poking his nose. Even Columbo does not reveal that he knows what's going on, he pretends to be honored and enthusiastic about this job offer. <br /> <br /> And there's one more where Columbo Kennicut before Brimmer says he wishes the murderers could hear their conversation. He wants to point out to Brimmer that he stands by him without directly charging him, so he decides cruelly (but understandably under the circumstances) to play mind games on Brimmer to panic him and do something stupid. What he does of course! The mourning Kennicut is unaware of the subtext of this conversation. It's only about to end that Columbo explains everything to Kennicut (not shown on the screen). <br /> <br /> I will not reveal how Columbo finally puts the killer pop in the nail, but let's just say that there is a potato. .. <br /> <br /> A really good episode, possibly the best of the first series.

Detective Philo Vance's powers of observation seem to be greater than all the oriental spying noses of the era when it comes to the final assessment of the murders. Dropping the dagger into the Chinese vase was the kicker for me; I mean, could not someone just drop it? <br /> <br /> Vance (William Powell) had a line at the beginning of the movie about Archer Coe's ""psychological impossibility"" of killing himself - I had to think about that for a while. I was wondering if there really is a scientific basis for this concept to be true and I did not study psychology myself. Seems logical, but then there is always the case that does not fit the rules. <br /> <br /> You know, I got kicked out of the agitated forensic scientist (Etienne Girardot), who sent me to Star Trek's dr. McCoy, the few times he said, ""I'm a doctor, not a magician"" and ""I'm a doctor, not a detective."" I can imagine DeForrest Kelley watching the movie and saying, ""I'll need that someday."" <br /> <br /> Once the killer's identity is revealed, it does not seem like a big surprise, but until then, it's really anyone's guess.

By following their story - instead of Simbas - we will see why all the animals bowed when Simba was presented by Pride Rock.

Nathan Lane as Timon gets most of the best jokes, but he is supported by Ernie Sabella as Pumbaa. It is also good to hear Matthew Broderick and Whoopi Goldberg re-live their roles. Julie Kavner and Jerry Stiller give their distinctive voice to two new characters: Timon's mother and uncle. The only downside is the constant stop-start rewind fast-forward device, which does not always help drive the story forward. With that said, there's a brilliant zoom near the beginning of the movie.

When they scam the rich and beautiful Grey Ellison into believing she backed her Mercedes into Bill, they're only hoping for a free meal. But Grey is touched, and over the objections of her snotty fiance, insist on putting the two up for the night. As they get to know each other, Bill becomes convinced that this is where Curly Sue belongs - in a home, cared for by someone that can give her the advantages that his homeless, nomadic existence lacks. He plans to leave the young girl in the care of Grey and take off.... but Curly Sue has other ideas!","Curly Sue is 6 years old and has a wealth of hair and a life as a drifter. She and her father, Bill (Jim Belushi), try to survive on the streets by being little contemporaries. In Chicago, Bill decides to jump in front of a car in an expensive car park, while Curly will yell at the strained victim's complaints and traction. It happens to be a very upscale lawyer named Gray (Kelly Lynch) who is appalled by what she did. The scammers not only earn money, they can also spend the night in Gray's apartment. Even then, Gray feels she owes them more, so the three stay together for a spell. Gray knows only the lucrative legal transaction and nothing about life. Who could teach her better than Bill and Curly, these savvy experts for the realities of life? But all good things must come to an end and there is no life left for a legal expert and a few cheaters. Or is it there? This is a sweet and funny movie about the unexpected. Curly is certainly as entertaining as Shirley Temple, but of course much edgier. Belushi gives a rare touchdown performance as the defeat on his lucky hit and Lynch is brilliant as the cocky but gentle touch lawyer. John Hughes, as writer and director, once again shows his magical touch, because the script is alive and unpredictable. Just watch as Curly and Bill Gray bring out a money-free night and see the humorous results. Do you long for Happy Endings, long promised and finally delivered, with a few uncertain moments in between? This is your tailor made movie."

Brodie is legendary (did he do it? - it's still a cause for altercation!), Jump from the Brooklyn Bridge (1886), for which he became famous, is shown here around the same time as the Spanish-American War (1898). Director Walsh clearly had a great affection for the time, so beautifully restored here, and it contains a wild rumbtime ragtime number from saloon singer Trixie Odbray (a young Pert Kelton).

The play ""Sister Mary Ignatius explains everything to you"" was - at least in Hollywood - presented in exactly the same tone as Diane Keaton's lecture scenes. Sister Mary was an exaggeration, a mockery, a bitter satire of a serene, self-assured, doctrinaire and high-judgmental nun - and as she was played by Lynn Redgrave, she was hilarious. But the film insists that we take this exaggeration absolutely seriously - while, as mentioned, the same tone is retained in the scenes ""explains everything"". The two approaches collide head-first and in the last twenty minutes the film leaves the track, plunges into the gorge and explodes. There are no survivors.

Forget about the fact that if these Master Intelligence agents chase after someone whose mere touch will kill you in about a minute, they will not wear protective gear (not even gloves).

These remarks come from someone who thinks Kane and Ambersons are amazing, worthy films. But the rest of Welles' career is unfortunately wasted on material unworthy of his talent and too skinny to resist his cinematic embroidery. And if he does a potboiler like Shanghai, the lack of something substantial to hang his cinematic tricks is just kind of sad. I could not tell you what he researched here. It's all mannered like Welles's godforsaken Irish brogue; This takes a lot of effort, but adds absolutely zero to the movie. Several Welles projects were so overdeveloped and baroque. Mr. Arkadin (choose a version, any version) is a similar project. The material is irrelevant. It just can not stand the weight of all this noodling. For a director dealing with reality-based drama (as here), he never feels an incentive to tie his bundle of imaginations back to reality; or to a coherent story. The murder-for-hire plan is ridiculous. <br /> <br /> Kudos to Welles, because Hayworth cut her hair and made that performance out of her. The camera loves her. She is the most classic, classy, ​​sultry and gorgeous femme fatale ever to be played on film. But their betrayal comes so late in the movie that it feels like a desperate decision, so the movie has a genre it fits into. The movie can not be saved by a noir convention that has been used in the last 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> If everything in L.F.S. said and done, are the folds all for what? to convince you that you have seen something thoughtful? Welles to do more? so that you twist your eyes? Welles has no sensitivity to the extent of a story or story to tell directly.

In this film Beatty managed to get all the famous cartoon characters out of the Strip and put them into an original script. <br /> <br /> The city's top gangster, Big Boy Caprice, is taking a step to really eliminate the competition.

Only Beatty plays it completely hetero, the others all seem to play from him. Dick Tracy won Oscars for Best Art & Set Design, Best Song written by Stephen Sondheim and introduced by Madonna, Sooner Or Later. The fact that he even got someone like Sondheim to write a score for this film just shows that Sondheim wanted to get involved in the fun. As far as Madonna is concerned, the material Girl with all these theatrical heavyweights as club-torch singer Breathless Mahoney more than lives up to her. <br /> <br /> Prior to this movie, Dick Tracy films were handed over to B-pictures and worse than Saturday afternoon series.

If a movie really deserves the title ""It's just a movie, just a movie, just a movie,"" it's this one. <br /> <br /> Highlights (or Lowlights) - a rapist who uses a vibrator on a victim as he masturbates over her, Harry Reems' stealing mustache, the helpless young black couple being forced to kill the sword killer beat (they would have won Oscars for their absolutely credible performance if the Academy had gone crazy) The man is castrated because of his problems, and a jerky, crafty way that threatens to lift the proceedings beyond their obvious grind-house origins. Do not say that I did not warn you. If you thought the world was an innocent place thirty years ago, you will be very, very wrong with SEX WISH."

I was shocked when I found out that it was released in 2001. Second, the plot was everywhere, and the story is confusing right away. Had there been a short prologue or an introduction, the story would have been better. I also value fantasy, but this movie was too much. It was bizarre and badly filmed. The scenes did not run smoothly and the characters were strange. It was hard to follow and maybe it was the translation, but it was even hard to understand. I love Chinese epic movies, but if you're looking for a Chinese epic fantasy movie, I would not recommend this movie Promise (visually stunning, plot is interesting and good character development).

You have to take it for what it is, a low-budget masterpiece where a zombie rapist swings a 12-inch love rod that makes him flutter. Those who came to give this film a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden ""gem,"" they say, and just did not quite get there. I like how everyone points to obvious observations like the ""5 cent baby attached to a fish rod"", haha, well. I do not think a movie with a budget like this could afford ""good"" actors or effects, so they worked with what they had. The guts and innards were indeed very convincing.

10,tt0042650,1,"""Kon-Tiki"" was the name of a wooden raft used by six Scandinavian scientists, led by Thor Heyerdahl, to make a 101-day journey from South America to the Polynesian Islands. The purpose of the expedition was to prove Heyerdal's theory that the Polynesian Islands were populated from the east---specifically Peru---rather than from the west (Asia)as had been the theory for hundreds of years. Heyerdahl made a study of the winds and tides in the Pacific, and by simulating conditions as closely as possible to those he theorized the Peruvians encountered, set out on the voyage.","The tweed professor types thought they had found out everything. The current populations of Polynesia were descended from migratory Asians, who streaked fearlessly for thousands of years from the Far East, island to island, east to Tahiti, and all the other exotic tropical islands of the South Pacific. But established thinking simply does not fit the young Norwegian ethnographer Thor Heyerdahl. If this explanation was correct, why did some of the people born and raised on these islands have traditions, works of art and physical characteristics similar to those of Asia but of South America? What can the vegetation of Ecuador, Peru and Chile look like on the island several thousand kilometers away? Is it just a coincidence that the islanders are pointing to the South American Sea and say that their ancestors come from there, led by Tiki, their equivalent of Adam? To what extent do Norwegians speak of Scandinavian precursors hunted out of their colonized South American continent and, together with some of the indigenous peoples with whom they had become friends, across the sea - to the west? It's all too much to be a coincidence for Heyerdahl. An expedition begins with an incredible amount of moxie, a handful of crewmen and local know-how for traditional raft building. It is as much an excursion into human imagination as a pseudo-scientific demonstration that such a journey is possible only with the foundations of tools and seamanship. The Oscar-winning documentary can be dated in its tone and Anglo-ethnocentric approach, but it does emerge with an adventurous spirit that even puts the space program, released a decade later, on the verge of risking everything a theory to test that they think is true. Wonderful. Do yourself a favor and read the book first. It's an amazing switcher and the perfect setup for the newsreel-style movie."

I was skeptical at first - the idea of ​​a computer virus that can infect people seemed a bit ridiculous. But in the end, I thought the movie worked well with the concept (though some scenes were a bit clichéd). The cast was pretty good and the two leads seemed to take their roles very seriously. I do not think Janine Turner looks a bit like a Geena Davis. Maybe it's just her face or the make-up, the hair, and the clothes she had in this movie, but it's always in the back of her mind. <br /> <br /> Although it's not a must have Fatal Error is an entertaining movie that will keep you watching until the end."

Thomas has caused the deaths of seven people talking on the phone while driving, and the film follows his attempt to atone for his obvious, unpardonable crime. <br /> <br /> The story is as subtle as a brick a green house window. What you see is exactly what happens - even the end of the Titanic was more surprising compared to Seven Pounds. There is absolutely no twist, there is never any confusion or doubt about what happens. <br /> <br /> I usually only like Will Smith when he's in Bad Boys mode. The guy is at his best when he carries a gun, drives a Ford GT and says ""Aw Hell Close"", when he tries to behave seriously, he just appears as a pathetic attempt to get an Oscar who is so desperate for , That's probably the main reason why I did not look forward to the movie, even though it's very understated here. There are moments of comedy, but they are subtle, in fact it was the most submissive performance of Will Smith I've ever seen, and for that very reason he was fantastic and ironic should be nominated for a grand prize. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast were all great too - Rosario Dawson looked pretty closely at deaths from throughout the movie and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were fine, with all the other little players. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a whiny - but it does not throw away all the usual clichés and sentimental violins to give you no choice but to cry. There were a few times that even my hard heart almost broke. It will be hard for you to find none of the situations that are not related to your own life, which makes it all the more real. <br /> <br /> I would give it 8/10.

The film is about a couple looking for a child, and those in real life who are in this situation will squirm over the depicted images. For example, scenes in a fertility clinic are not the least bit funny and are, frankly, embarrassing. The male lead, who plays a construction worker and in his safety helmet, comes as a bad excuse for rejecting Village People. The female lead is trying to look 20 years younger than she is. Both leads are unattractive, unattractive and unconvincing. In the film, there are various ridiculous and inconspicuous scenes, for example, with a low-cost airline that has no sense of humor. The only reason I give this 3/10 instead of 1/10 is a score for Shirley Maclaine, who is a class above anything else in the picture, and a grade for a reasonably decent (if old) music."

The movie has a very professional look. It shows that Mr. Washington learned a lot on the other side of the camera. He brings a different perspective on this film. <br /> <br /> One of the best things the movie has is undoubtedly Derek Luke's good performance. He is an actor who will undoubtedly go far with the right guidance. His attitude towards the troubled young man who at this point in his life has been hurting him in turmoil and suffering for a bad hand life, until now, is very true. His answer is a beautiful portrait of a man in pain, who is basically very good and has so much to give, but no one seems to see that side of his character. <br /> <br /> In the worst of his despair, Antwone becomes drunk in a very sober, if somewhat subdued way.

Antwone's past is revealed in detail. The abuse he suffers in the hands of Ms. Tate, his foster-mother, is brutal, to say the least. The attempt of an elderly woman in the household of the Tate to be sexually harassed, gives Antwone a bitter aftertaste that accompanies him throughout his adult life, as he is marked by the shame he carries with him. <br /> Finally, Antwone finds love for Cheryl, patient enough to let him see her through the love she gives her and the support she gives him. <br /> <br /> The lead performances are really good. Dr. Davenport by Denzel Washington also has its own problems. He is not a happy camper either. He can help Antwone, but he can not help it, or his relationship with a worshiping woman. <br /> <br /> The talent in the movie is incredible. Joy Bryant makes a fine cherry. Novella Nelson, who is a good actress, is outstanding as Mrs. Tate, the abusive foster mother. <br /> <br /> The reunion of Antwone with his unknown family is a bit too sweet and sentimental, but of course, if you believe that Fisher finally finds happiness, then you have to accept that part of the movie as well."

It was not a bad movie, just another movie in which I said, ""Well, that was nothing special,"" after I saw it. There was probably drama and stuff, but it just did not grab me, but was rather half-dull. As I said in the headline, it was, in a sense, very cheap. The quality of the film itself (the images) was of inferior quality, reminding me of cheap TV movies rather than a respected English filmmaker. The camera angles and recordings were in my opinion very amateurish. There were no close-ups or similar effects to create interesting scenes. I have not seen many English films and the ones I saw did not really impress me more than that and they lined up something similar to what was done with the camera work, the colors and stuff like that.

Amazes some things from the first ""Return of the Living Dead"" films. Cardboard sign. Because of the bad rock music of the 1980s (not that I say that all the rock music of the time is bad), the clothes and overall look of the movie, he did not age too well. <br /> <br /> Final Thoughts: Above all, this is not a true continuation of Fulci's cult classic. In fact, I do not know if it was ever meant to pick up where this movie left off. For those who do not know, Fulci was ill during production and ended up leaving and was replaced by Bruno Mattei. Mattei movies are pretty ridiculous, but like this movie, many are good campy fun. And that's all this movie really is, just something that you can see for fun. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 5 (So-bad-it-good rating) 2/5 (Serious review)"

When filming begins, so do the killings.","A student filmmaker hires a B-class actress (a delicious diva-MOLLY RINGWALD!) To complete the horror film that her mom (a terribly boring Kylie Minogue!) Tries to make 12 years ago. It is a curious decision to act, to say the least, as every Australian horror fan knows that the genre unfortunately lacks female directors. The movie has a curse because Molly had to kill a psychopath on the original set. But she is back because she needs the exposure. Unfortunately, the curse is still there and people are starting to die on the ""set"". Cut is an Australian attempt by the modern Slasher, but unfortunately it does not bring anything new or exciting to the table. In fact, it breaks half of Wes Craven's 90s filmography. Many film world name drop a la ""Scream"" (except it's Aussie name drop - Jane Campion ... see how that's not so funny) and many ""is this real or is it a movie"" a la ""new Nightmare ""The editing is bad, the music is annoying, the effects are ridiculous, almost everything is bad. Fortunately, the film can have a sense of humor: at one point, a well-dressed girl in the film crew tells the owner of the house where they are filming: ""Do not worry, we'll treat your house as if it was ours own, ""to which he answers"", that does not mean anything to me, you look like you live in a garbage dump! ""Ha! And Molly's ridiculous one-liners were enough not to regret renting it. ""Do you have any cola in here?""

You can say a lot about this series, and a lot has been said, so I will not be the one to spell it back for you. Just read the people who loved it and you'll know why you want to see it. The beauty of this series is that it is completely new. There are not many films - and even fewer - series that are based solely on the theme of suspense, but Lost does justice to the theme with pride. It's all about the unexplainable and if you combine that with an exotic location, nice plot twists, excellent cast and a good format (present and past combined in separate episodes) you'll have a series where every episode is a story own, but part of a larger narrative. You want to have all the insights of the characters, you want to see the big picture, and you'll want to know where the scribes bring you. The result is that it's a series that will not let you go. More skeptical, the series went back a little in season 2, probably because of its own success. It is known that Lost was originally written for only one season and when the overwhelming success followed, the authors were overwhelmed. In my opinion, they have made the mistake of adding more secrets and at a higher speed in the second season to then solve the (at least in part) of the first season. At the end of the second season, everything ended with a great blurring of secrets, plot changes, and unexplained phenomena, but there is only so much that a viewer can see. The difference between Season 2 and 3, however, was enormous. Season 3 provided many insights to partially replace them with new questions. And that's the way they should write; You want to scroll from one action to the next, do not make a tsunami of secrets about you, and then track down a few to explain to the audience. They have the third season and bring us a bright future for the fourth season. It's good to see that another format of a series is so popular."

And why on earth did ABC agree - as the press reported - to buy Geico's cave rights? After all, the idea of ​​cavemen fighting in the modern world is hardly unique to television; Phil Hartman had a recurring Saturday Night Live role as The Unfrozen Caveman Lawyer over a decade ago. And this is how such a concept works best - as an occasional installation. But a regular series? Fuhgeddaboudit. (A series from the 1960s titled ""It's About Time"" also used the cavemen in the concept of the modern world.) It lasted one season.) One of the show's directors, also responsible for the Geico commercials, was recently quoted as saying ""We were so excited when we shot our commercials because we felt we had something that was very unique and we had bigger stories to tell."" Not correct. <br /> <br /> In the annals of bad television, this will be considered one of the worst of all time, alongside the ""Me and the Chimpanzee"" of 1972.

The problem with this movie is that it purposely tries to annoy the viewer, and with great success. What I want to know is, is this supposed to be a horror movie? I mean, it's definitely awful, but not the way horror movies should be. I could see the first segment trying to be horror and fail, but what the hell is the second segment? It's just annoying.

I was looking for similar movies, in the age limit. I then found «Presque Rien», a film in which director Sébastien Lifshitz amazed us in a wonderful way and in 2000 received a nomination for the Cannes Festival. The story is about two guys, the boys next door, Mathieu (Jérémie Elkaïm) and Cédric (Stéphane Rideau), who meet during the summer holidays. In a country far from where he lives, Mathieu spends days with his sister on the beach. There he meets Cédric, a local, with whom he begins this summery and enlightening relationship, very much through the sensual and seductive personality that Stéphane Rideau gives to his characters (in Les 6 - year olds he still preserves the 6 innocence of the sweet seducer, Witch matures here). A role model in directing, in the amorous order, in the intimate and self-confessed description made about a boy who first faces his (still ambiguous) sexuality and great love. The first love, in its terrible progression, ecstasy-despair. The best of the film is the best of France: the passionate passion, the hot and excited rationalism, the brownish beauty, the simple and natural acceptance of the families, albeit not without surprise and first rage. Yet there are the beach, the luminosity, the lightness, the simplicity of the summer, the freshness of the breeze, the melody of the wave and the expressive eyes of an introverted Elkaïm (hesitant, hurt, confused, passionate). Gender is not shunned or exploited, it is treated as it is, without an exhibitionistic intention. This is a work of dramas of unusual quality, without cheap sentimentalism, and shows an inevitably real image of two homosexuals in their best youth, just like any ordinary human being, albeit with a social fear of rejection and shame. It's well worth seeing, especially by those who love French films (though the DVD front page is very lame, with the two actors between dozens of stars greased with Brilliantine). A movie witch deserves an 8-9 in my opinion!"

It should not shock anyone that I believe the latter is. This show is a parody of a sitcom and society, a program so absurd that it loses its absurdity and it's just not funny. A woman has farted many times because it is not common. We do not need 25 minutes of it. When a criminal is disarmed by a Queef, he simply loses his attraction - we saw it in Jay and Silent Bob Strike, except that the women were hotter, and the whole scene was more absurd, made it better.

It had a better acting, and I think a bit more of a fantastic realistic look. <br /> <br /> Maybe the fact that some reviews are so negative (I'm very skeptical of the critical acclaim, but do not deny fan reaction) To this show is the amount of advertising, very offensive advertising by many Programs far beyond advertising for other programs. Many people wonder why Sarah Silverman has a career and others are still bitter when better shows are canceled. This show should never have passed the pilot phase. Back to Norm showed much more promise, but this show makes it happen. And as far as critics are right, many things that have been commonly panned have seen their status rise immensely.

When they see each other, Jaffar uses magic to blind Ahmad and turn Abu into a dog. Is their love doomed?","I grew up with it as my favorite movie.

Let me see now, I'm still trying to defend it. Oh yes, the chick of Clueless was in it. Do not drop Stacy Dash. I mean, we all make mistakes. But boy, Stacy, you made a dooooosie. <br /> <br /> Hey, one thing that was never done in a western, even female occupation, they actually hanged a woman off the gallows. That could be a western premiere. Although her neck should have been broken and she survived the ordeal, you still have to give the director some trouble trying a western. Besides, I've never seen a woman lynched in a Western by a horse, though that did not happen in this movie. I just thought I would give the director another idea for Gang Of Roses # 2, which should be done right after Ed Woods Bride of the Monster # 2. Maybe that was the creators of this movie. Orginality, especially with a very African women cast and an oriental cowgirl. <br /> <br /> Heeey, if the creators of Gang Of Roses want to make a sequel to this mess, you could have a slang like, ""Hey, do not you understand about my homegirls"" and ""talk by the hand, Baby, speak with your hand.

Like all revenge movies, he has villains that you would like to throw out of a glass window on the top floor of a 40-story building! Double Impact, however, has not stifled sensational crap that struck the plot and the elitist, racist and venomous social stereotypes, the ""Eye for a Eye"" and ""Death Wish 2"". <br /> <br /> But in the The Double Actually the plot division is as transparent as Saran Wrap. Chad's and Alex's parents were killed by a mob squad who was linked to a friend of the family who had money problems, or at least I remembered it. The explanation why the guys spoke in French accents is a lousy one. It was not the watery action that made this movie bad, but the use of cliché lines and movements from other films (from Lethal Weapon to The Princess Bride) really made it worse. Nevertheless, Double Impact is still visible. But why did those shitty films have such rogues (for example, this greedy British man who killed Chad and Alex's parents and that deadly lesbian redhead), would you love to hate with the fiber of your being?"

You do not feel like meeting any of the main characters. And the plot development is slow, boring and I know what will happen in 30 minutes. Score / music is ultra-clear, as there are a lot of overpriced people out there who would score points for a coke and a credit, but that's a big shit. Some of the special effects are nice when done in the early '90s. If you like Slimy Aliens, chills and thrills, do not watch this movie. It's a very boring combination of The Thing, Alien 3, Outbreak and some Jerry Bruckheimer / Michael Bay productions really bad. Now this combination would be cool if anyone knew what they were doing and the only people in the production who knew that were nobody. <br /> <br /> Although I have seen much worse, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you are on a cold night and just want to glorify, it will slowly pass the time."

Ultimatum is one of the most compelling films, attracting attention from the first second to the last minute. <br /> <br /> Matt Damon was just fantastic as his role as Jason Bourne.

The Bourne ultimatum made me cry that the show was over, but I could not even smile for hours. <br /> <br /> From the moment the opening title appeared, I knew we had a chance to ride. Paul Greengrass has done it again. Everything we love about the previous Bourne movies is here again: the action, the dialogue, and of course the shaky camera. For me, the last was never a problem.

If the fight against apartheid was something, it was a black fight, but somehow we should all be caught by the flight of a white man and his family.

It's amazing to think that two boys with handguns and mopeds can generate 10 times more tension than anything these 150 million giant robots did in Transformers. <br /> <br /> Create it with Paul Greengrass, who has this idiosyncratic style of shooting Stedicam a la documentary, even though he films characters that are anything but ordinary, in places like the CIA headquarters where nobody with one Camcorder is allowed within 10 miles. He seemed to listen to my various complaints with Supremacy, since the act in Ultimatum is nothing short of awe, with various devices used as weapons that are a candlestick, a hardcover book (I will never look at them the same way again) and an electric fan (do not ask). The music has also helped to create a lot of suspense, and there was hardly a moment not to bite. <br /> <br /> The acting is good and the development of Julia Stiles' character ""Nicky"" has staged her situation a new highly sympathetic light. Damon plays his signature role with restraint, but with competence (which sounds slightly small but actually looks like Matt Damon could dodge the CIA and Interpol is something), but noticeable moments of sharpness as he still tries to do his humanity Find. This longing for a real life could get boring, and almost in Supremacy, but it just works better in Ultimatum (better script). <br /> <br /> I recall a scene in ""Goldeneye"" (the only good movie by Pierce Brosnan Bond) in which Sean Bean's character James asks if the martinis will ever silence the screams of all the men who he killed. Bourne deplores all the people he has killed, and he thinks (or at least thought about it) about the meaning of action without purpose, life without meaning and how the government has turned men into resources. Still, resources that know Krav Maga and can make weapons out of anything. <br /> <br /> Note: It always bothered me that despite everything, he's a super spy and is being chased almost everywhere by the CIA, Interpol and the police, so Bourne never thought of trying his very best Disguise facial features or forge new passports. Sunglasses maybe? <br /> <br /> If you have a pulse and love action movies, Bourne Ultimatum is for you. Damn, it's probably the best action movie coming out this year. Of course, it would be an idiot to see it without first watching the others. In the end it does matter, but I'm almost tempted to overlook that. This is the first ""3"" movie to reach or surpass at least the original this summer and that says something. <br /> <br /> A-"

Hopper is an excellent characterization of the always wonderful Kevin Spacey, as is Haydn Panettiere as Dot. There is also Sterling support from Dennis Leary, David Hyde Pierce and Madeline Kahn, and I could go on and on. The script is awesome, so funny and sometimes even touching.

The new story could have been really funny when Ethel was sent to a halfway house and murdered everyone, but until the last 20 minutes of the movie, nothing happens and you fall asleep at this point. <br /> <br /> The camera work in this movie is just horrible.

It's a good word to sum up Bernard Rose's brilliantly haunting and poetic paperhouse. A movie so simple it's almost impossible to explain and impossible to forget. While you can find this puppy in your horror area, it's anything but. It is more of a serious imagination, expertly directed and exceptionally well played, especially Charlotte Burke and Elliot Speirs (Marc). And yet it is not a children's movie, but to remind us of those carefree days that are now only dark memories. Rose creates a rich tapestry of moody ambience that creates an exciting backdrop to the brilliant story and great actor. Paperhouse refrains from trying to explain its dreamy qualities and leaves most things to the imagination of the beholder. There is a lot of symbolism and ambiguity that you can bite into. Paperhouse likes to play with the mind of the beholder and captivate you with its very own sense of reasoning. As the story unfolded, I was always impressed with how powerful the movie was until the finale, leaving me with a smile on my face and a tear in my eyes. <br /> <br /> Bernard Rose's visuals are brilliant here. He is able to create an unnervingly gloomy atmosphere that seems simple on the surface, but as a whole is much larger than the sum of its parts. The acting is from the young Charlotte Burke in this, her feature film debut, is also really impressive. Unfortunately, she has not graced the screen since then. A deserved Burnout Central Prize seems only appropriate for this performance. Towards the end, the film lingers a bit here and there, but I easily missed it. I wish they had taken a darker turn and created a much more powerful finale, which in retrospect would have proved all the more annoying and truly captivating. The movie as it is is still one for the books and deserves to be seen by any serious movie lover. It's a poetic journey told through the innocent eyes of a child, a powerful movie that has much to think about and much more to praise."

That is already a rare achievement for television films. <br /> <br /> Secondly, I agree with others about the casting. I could not imagine a better choice for Captain Holland than Richard Dean Anderson. Literally, the film could have crashed and burned without proper occupation for this pivotal role. Anderson has never been better, and it's a shame we did not see him anymore. In fact, all the performers have done an excellent job.

Basically, we're talking about less than 36 hours to orchestrate and execute a plan like this, and people, that's just not realistic with all the players involved. Also unrealistic was how little the airliner was affected, first having then blown off two of its engines. <br /> <br /> The beef aside, I enjoyed the building voltage and found it very believable, as the reactions of foreign governments were portrayed both in the film and in our films. <br /> <br /> If you have the opportunity to watch this movie, definitely do it."

Snafu learns that his family are almost as commited to the war efforts as himself.,"Frank Tashlin's ""The Home Front"" is one of the lifeless Private Snafu short films, a series of cartoons made as instructional films for the military. Instead of doing Snafu some inappropriate acts that lead to disaster, ""The Home Front"" focuses instead on his loved ones at home and on how much they have to offer the war effort. Snafu realizes that he was wrong when he thought it was easy for them. It's a concept with few opportunities for good jokes and instead Tashlin plays the daring card stronger, widening jokes with strippers and slightly dressed dancers instead of effective comic relief. The result is a well-meaning abbreviation that today has little relevance or entertainment value as a historical artifact."

This proves to be difficult when the line between his fantasy life and reality becomes blurred, and he finds himself seduced by the charms of Dragonfly.","CQ was the worst movie I've seen this year. Almost every movie I see in the theater is at least entertaining or has something to say. This film looked like it had been staged by a film student for his intro. for filmmaking. His father makes big films. His sister has done a good job. But brother Roman? NO! One critic had the audacity to compare this movie to Godard's Le Mépris (contempt). While Coppola jr. Having the same idea, a movie about film, he tried too hard to make himself European, artistic and witty, when all is just kitsch. The lead actor wears the same expression throughout the movie as if he were either in awe or shocked that this movie was made around him. Schwartzman somehow manages to drop his role as an extravagant director. Depardieu is fine. The one scene that has any real movie spoof humor is, surprisingly, not the B-movie scene, but one that plays in Italy; a montage of shots of different characters in a very small car, driving around and picking up random people. That was the only thing that reminded me of the movie that I suspect has tried. Or rip off. Or both. The documentary film starring in the camera and filming various objects was played, the ending was given a ""twist"" or artistic value ... I think the funniest thing about this movie was the movie itself and not so as it was intended. No wonder this film was sent back after a festival screening to be re-cut or re-shot or whatever, which makes me curious how bad it was before. I can not believe it could have been worse. If you want to see a good spoof of the movie, check out the films by Austin Powers. All of them. The opening to the third is more entertaining and ingenious than this whole movie.

Her Internet search leads her to a man who believes that the Doctor is an immortal alien who has been instrumental in averting various Earthly disasters. Their paths cross again and Rose helps the Doctor in fighting a race of plastics-based creatures whose home world may have been destroyed in a battle involving the Doctor. Rose seems like the perfect companion for his future travels.,"As an integral part of British pop culture such as Monty Python and James Bond, Doctor Who was a big hit for 26 years (1963-1989), making it one of the world's longest-running TV shows (most series are lucky) ten seasons). Plans to restart the series have always been on the BBC's agenda, and after a miscalculated (not to be Americanized) TV movie produced by Fox, he did not manage to complete the magic of the original version for nine years Captured (Comic Relief Parody and Animated Miniseries) were needed before the Ultimate Time Lord could properly return, courtesy of acclaimed writer Russell T. Davies. <br /> <br /> Davies Brilliance in reintroducing the character lies in his decision to do so through the eyes of an outsider: Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), a London-based young woman who leads a normal life, until one night it is attacked by living plastic creatures. She is rescued by an elusive stranger, who simply introduces herself as a doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and then disappears after annoying: ""Nice to meet you, Rose, run for your life!"". As she becomes more and more curious about this ""man,"" she soon finds herself in a whole new world: extraterrestrials, invasions, journeys through time and space, and of course the ubiquitous police box-shaped TARDIS. <br /> <The first 45 minutes of the new Doctor Who are almost perfect (the special effects could have been polished a bit more), because Davies noticed two things: the unique humor of the show and the two protagonists. The most original feature of the original series was their mix of spectacular science fiction and pure British comedy, a mixture that is difficult, if not impossible, to export. Here, the laughs are all connected to the conversations between Rose and the Doctor, which after a single episode appear as completely rounded characters. Ok, Eccleston's Doctor is the ninth to use that name, but he distances himself from the previous eight incarnations by speaking with a Nordic accent (which he uses daily) and stating it with a grandiose line: ""Many planets have a north ! "". <br /> <br /> The true triumph of this episode, however, is Piper's achievement: in theory, Rose is in her late teens, almost the same age as thousands of young audiences who have never heard of the doctor before. Her portrayal of an ordinary girl, lost in a new, exciting universe, represents the new generation's response to the return of a TV icon, and the chemistry that is currently forming between her and Eccleston is a sign of the new Doctor Who, the old one is just as good. <br /> <br /> First, fifth, ninth, it makes no difference: There might have been others before Eccleston (and Piper, for that matter), but together he is, William Hartnell, Peter Davison, and the rest of the bunch a single character, one so cool, he does not even need a name: he is THE Doctor."

It is so bad. So far from anything that could be called a movie, story, or anything that was ever to be created and brought into our existence. <br /> <br /> That made me question if people really are on this earth or are not doing good. I felt disgusted with ourselves and our progress as a species in this universe. This kind of movie truly hurts us as a society. We should be ashamed. I really can not stress that our global responsibility as people living and creating art is that we must prevent the emergence of these blatant distortions of our reality for our own benefit.

I really do not want to see the ""shaky"" camera drug intoxication effect or Jump Cuts or Swerve Cuts or any Fancy Cut Ever Again Ever. This is meticulously boring, repetitive and simply teases the audience. <br /> <br /> But ....... and let me be specific here, the DAMAGE to this movie is that in the face of production it appears that a pretty decent amount of money has actually been put into these excrements. Personally, I'll grab the director's shoulders if I ever see him and shake him to servility and demand that he run home and swallow two liters of Drain-O or I'll do it for him. <br /> <br /> Once we have needed a new form of inhumane torture for our POWs abroad, show them this movie over and over again in a padded cell.

Her brother trains boxing in a gym and one day, when she picks him up, she decides that she wants to work out as well. <br /> <br /> It would be easy to call this movie a ""rocky girl,"" I think. But that's not what it's all about. The story actually benefits greatly from the fact that the main character is more of a girl than a boy. That way you can handle more problems at the same time. First, the problem that she is not accepted because she is not a girl, and then when she goes into the pits because she's a girl at all. It's also a story about how one purpose can change another's life. How positive things can make you grow. I do not want that to sound pretentious, because the movie does not look pretentious at all, but what I'm saying is true. <br /> <br /> Michelle Rodriguez is also very good in the lead. It's really a shame that she's now stuck in the ""hard girl"" typing, because that's not really her role in ""Girlfight"". Sure, she's a boxer, but it's the more sensitive moments that really make her shine. <br /> <br /> So maybe that's your average underdog story with a twist, but she's been raised far above the crowd by Rodriguez.

But the special effects in ""DinoCroc"" were better, the storylines were better and the acting was better. Here are the issues with ""Blood Surf"" - 1) The killer crocodile looks like a kid's model with a retractable jaw. 2) the plot is ridiculous. Matt Borlenghi & Co. are shipwrecked on a deserted island, where they meet a rabid group of ugly Filipino natives trying to force themselves on the women in the group. What a complete waste of 15 minutes movie was. And 3) there is not enough croc time.

There's even some decent humor about how two of our leads discuss how to decide if a dead zombie is really dead. <br /> <br /> If you can overlook the low budget (which leaves its fingerprints on everything, oh) and the almost constant obscenities, that can be a pretty fun time in the cinema. No, it's not great. Yes, it could have been better. But the creators, the actors, the crew, all tried to make a good movie (instead of a camp classic) and that counts for a lot.

For teens who want to get rid of a potential stepfather, this can have a certain appeal. Do not be impressed that David Niven plays the Playboy father and Deborah Kerr the stepmother. Unfortunately, too much is on the fragile shoulders of Jean Seberg. She is beautiful and easily fulfills the image of a spoiled teenager. The problem is that she can make poses, but she can not act. Anyone who saw her as Jeanne d'Arc in Otto Preminger's first film, St. Joan-Seberg, knows that at the age of 19 she could not produce a film. This film, also by Preminger, fulfills the ""promise"" of the first. It was her second movie; She was 20. What did Preminger think? That Niven and Kerr could compensate for Seberg's lack of ability to act? No chance? Seberg's character is at the heart of the story and although she is so convincing, she may be physically 17 years old, but she can not fulfill the emotional demands of the role. I do not know if she ever became a successful actress in her short life because she had no influence on my consciousness in her later pictures.

An underlying theme is particularly disturbing (as in: vintage shock material), and that's basically what the movie is about. Performances and cinematography are way above average compared to many other movies from the late '70s / early' 80s, but what really makes me recommend this film is the rather long climax scene in the basement. From the moment the ""Keller Junior"" characters were introduced, his performance dropped my jaw and she closed at the end of the movie.

Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, appeared in cinemas this week with little more than a peep. I saw no previews, just a few commercials. The critical reaction is a kind of blah. I would not have seen it if I had not waited for a friend to see the Bourne ultimatum, and nothing interesting was opening this weekend. Well, if you forgive the awful pun, the stars must be right, because I went to Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a big movie like Lord of the Rings. The storyline is your very simple fantasy quest (the hero goes in search of a fallen star), which is full of obstacles. But within this outline, the story is alive and imaginative. It just aims to make a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. And it works wonderfully. There were a lot of big movies this summer, but none of them was almost as funny as this one. There is a lot going on, but the story is well told and almost completely coherent. It's not a masterpiece, but it can definitely take the same floor as the Princess Bride (though I do not like it as much as the previous movie). Have fun here if you are a fan of the genre."

Although her role in ""serious"" roles (see Hope Floats, Speed ​​2, 28 Days) is decent in courageous, self-evasive roles, she leaves much to be desired. Her character is at the same time omniscient, confused and sexually unadapted (the sub-plot of Sandra's past acts as a superfluous filler that does little to develop her already flat character).

Acting is great, 70mm cinematography is gorgeous, Oscar-nominated costumes and sets are stunning, and Patrick Doyle's score (also Oscar-nominated) is sensitive and moving. Oh yes - the screenplay by Will S. is not bad either. Film critics agreed with Branagh when he received the fourth Oscar for ""adapting"" the script, but his decision to use the entire text was bolder. I can not imagine many better ways to fly four hours. <br /> <br /> Almost every decision that Branagh makes makes brilliant work: using the English Blenheim Palace for the exterior, the Edwardian clothing and the staging of being or not in a hall of mirrors to name a few. The cast of Hollywood greats like Robin Williams, Billy Crystal and Jack Lemmon in small parts may distract, but that's fussy. The main character is distinguished: Derek Jacobi captures the contradictory nature of Claudius; Kate Winslet describes sharply Ophelia's descent into madness; Julie Christie introduces passion into her portrayal of Gertrude; Richard Briers is pitch-perfect like the Conniving Polonius; and Nicholas Farrell highlights Horatio's potentially ungrateful role in the apotheosis of true friendship. Every speech, every line, every word is conveyed with passion and conviction; There is no wasted moment in the whole movie. The last scenes increase the extent of Shakespeare's tragedy in a way that is not possible with theatrical adaptations. <br /> <br /> Branagh's ""Hamlet"" is a bold, ambitious and ultimately successful attempt to match the size and poetry of Shakespeare's language as well as eloquent images. It's probably the biggest Shakespearean adaptation ever made ?? High praise, but well deserved."

But if you judge that show in the last season, it will naturally appear inferior.

The acting was terrible at best. Tim Roth did a good job, as did Liam Neeson, but I have no idea what Jessica Lange was thinking. <br /> <br /> The story line was good, but the execution was just bad. I am so sorry that Scotland is portrayed in the movies like this. Braveheart was even worse, these are films that only save grace.

As an almost brand new director, there are some amazing dream sequences and brilliant editing segments that show why Hitchcock attracted so much attention early in his career. Granted, the movie starts with things, among other things, the most disconcerting spectacle of an idiot black circus artist (and I use idiot in the final manner, as Stephen King does so often) eggs and fruit from a bevy of not the noblest white people on him thrown. I suppose that just shows how incredibly different those circuses and people were back then, but I think it's one of the most daunting sequences in any Hitchcock movie I've seen. <br /> <br /> The main attraction at the circus is a fighter who claims to be able to knock everyone down in one round, but when he hits his match, it's against a man who has his authority not only in the boxing ring, but also in the ring to challenge the finger of his wife. So begins an entertaining, if not very tense, challenge for the love of a woman who effortlessly and thoughtlessly swings from one man to another. <br /> <br /> (Spoiler) For example, there is a scene where her husband watches her from the top when she is dropped off at home late at night, and just before she goes into the building she becomes the Car returned to a kiss. This kiss is never explained, and there is also the fact that in the end, if she remains true to her husband or at least ultimately chooses to meet her, she will look each other in the eye but not really kiss her. <br /> <The film is certainly beautifully photographed, even more so than some of the films Hitch published in the following years. There is also a performance by Gordon Harker as One Round Jack's coach, who often reminds me of the brilliant Buster Keaton in his stone expressionism. Hitch makes it a bit ambiguous, but that's a great sample of his early work."

While I realize that there is a third film I have not seen yet, I will read under the original title ... <br /> <br /> Only from the point of view of production value, screenwriting and film production, this film fails on many levels, even if some succeed. What can you expect from a low budget ""B"" movie? Not much, and it works from the point of view of production. However, the writing is certainly disconnected, with little character development ... exactly what I would expect if there is a movie. I had no problem with acting ... the cast is solid; However, the script in both films gives the performers little opportunity to really stretch. Because the film is ""Christian,"" this is predictable, as one can not well portray violent chaos of the ""end times"" without also breaking some of the ethical norms normally associated with Christianity. In other words, the mistake is to turn this into a G-weighted film if the content, even in the most conservative biblical interpretation, would be R-rated by some measure. So, if the purpose of the film is to scare people into the Christian faith, then the movie should be a bit scary, right? However, you can not comment on a movie adaptation from a book without commenting on the book or, in this case, a number of books. There are certainly many Christian materials that are worth making for films ... but not the ""Left Behind"" series ... and these films eventually fail because they are bestselling poorly written novels that are down to bad Theology As a Southern Baptist minister, I confess that the books were a guilty pleasure for me, although I still have to complete the last two books in the series. I have described them as decent fiction, and if the books were to argue that this is a ""possibility"" or interpretation of the theme of biblical eschatology (study of the ""end times""), then I could live with it. This series is in Christian circles splitting, because it promotes the ""literal"" interpretation of all Scripture on a more appropriate hermeneutics. This inevitably leads to the standpoint of the ""pre-tributary, millennia-old"" disposition that removes an all-encompassing, powerful God far too far from the human world, in other words, as I have always said, God should be our helicopters and bombs It is not because they need the ultimate work, but because many people, especially unthinking Christians, can not think beyond their own thoughts. Worldviews have a pro-conservative, fundamentalist attitude to the interpretation of the Bible and seek to impose it as the ""only"" interpretation. <br /> <br /> So the books carry with them agenda, not so much to understand the ""lost"" their need for Christ, but to say that the fundamentalist standpoint is the only valid way to understand the Bible , I remember very clearly a couple of years ago, in the second novel, when I read a scene in which the characters refer to a person who was ""left behind"" because he did not hold that view; as if ""real"" Christians who were worthy of being ""caught up"" could not possibly cling to another eschatology. This is troubling for several reasons, the least of which is because a ""rapture"" is mentioned only briefly in the Scriptures and their connection to real end-time prophecies is at best weak. <br /> <br /> But the real problem With these books comes how they share the Christian community and how they present ""true"" Christian behavior. Ultimately, I feel that they are hardening more people to an otherwise legitimate belief / religion rather than gaining people for it. It turns all Christians into caricatures that are both despised and ridiculed by the world, even though there is a theological space for a great variety of Christian beliefs and behaviors. As a Christian body, we have done such a damage to society in 2000 years of history on the whole ... and we certainly do not need to promote it through film to thousands, maybe millions, of others. <The ""Left Behind"" films fail because the ""Left Behind"" books are not suitable for being translated into movies."

After the four remaining girls are reunited at her funeral, they all start receiving threatening cards and ...","""Valentine"" is another horror movie added to the list of stalk and slash movies (think of ""Halloween"", ""Friday the 13th"", ""Scream"" and ""I know what you did last summer"") ). It's certainly not as good as the movies I've listed, but it's better than most of the rip-offs that come after the first ""Friday the 13th."" Movie came out. One of these films was the 1981 Canadian ""My Bloody Valentine"", which I hated very much. ""Valentine"" is a better movie than this, but it does not say much. The plot: A nerdy boy is teased and beaten by a couple of classmates at the beginning of the movie. Then the movie moves years later, when these classmates are all grown up, they are picked one by one. It is believed that the killer is the boy who has now grown up and is looking for revenge. But is he? Or could it be someone else? ""Valentine"" has an attractive cast that includes Denise Richards, David Boreanaz, Marley Shelton, Jessica Capshaw and Katherine Heigl. They do what they can with the material they have, but a lackluster script does not really do them justice. There are, however, some scary moments. <br /> <br /> ** (of four)"

Unsure of what happened, the animals set out on a quest to find their family. This journey across America is very dangerous and the animals risk never seeing their masters again. The group of pets travel across forested mountains and areas of wide-open countryside, while their family searches for them in the same areas.","I watch this movie all the time. I have seen it with family 3 to 87 and everyone in between; They all loved it. It really shows the true scenes a dog has and the love and loyalty you get from a pet. Just beautiful. <br /> <br /> It's great for those who love comedy movies, tear-jerker movies or just pets. <br /> <br /> The music is wonderful, the animals spectacular, the scenes really thought out and the characters perfect. What I liked about the characters are the true and well-mixed personalities: Shadow (The Elder, a Golden Retriever) He is the sage who is filled with the wisdom and mindset of every dog. Chance (the American Bulldog puppy) is basically a puppy with a witty side, the funny character; And Sassy (The Hymilayan cat) She is the real cat that shows what a real cat will do for her owner, the real girly."

She becomes despondent and leaves him, returning to her father's house. One day while bathing in the lake she meets a young man and they fall in love. The husband has become grief stricken at the loss of his young bride, and fate brings him together with the young lover that has taken Eva from him.","First, let's clear the ""hoopla"" out of the way. Hedy Lamarr was considered one of the most beautiful women and the films were a perfect medium for the many to see their beauty on screen. Here we have Hedy as a young boy I recently bought an uncensored version of this classic from 1932/3. Yes, we see a short close-up of Hedy, who is naked from the hip, but although she has filmed the floating and run-away horse scenes naked, the director Gustav Machaty uses the cover of twigs, reflections in puddles, medium and long shots to show her so in this famous scene; So, do not imagine that there are any lascivious close-ups or clinches. Your friend, Pierre Nay, always keeps his clothes. Yeah, pretty daring for his day, but how pushy he looks now through 2003. <br /> <As other scholarly accounts have said, this film should be considered for the imaginary, expressionistic and allegorical statements it makes with images of water droplets that ripple on the surface of a pale of water, agricultural machinery, landscapes, etc . form. Sweet-sounding strings run almost the full length of ""ecstasy"" and the film has a ""feel"" for a transition between silence and sound towards and concept. The script is very minimalist and economical, with the story being conveyed mainly through the face and face, physical gestures with just a few words of German spoken by the actors with English subtitles underneath. Even those few words seem almost superfluous in the general lyric vein that runs through the film. <br /> <br /> Put simply, this is the story of a young girl wh o marries a much older man (why is she never told us and what has Eve ever seen in him? money?), which is then in a fresh and unloving Marriage is caught. She then returns to her father after leaving her husband and father to lie to his son-in-law. After a ride on her horse, Eva decides to swim in the strengthening swimmer and load her clothes onto the saddle of her horse. However, her horse gets romantic ideas herself and gallops to salute his stable mate out of the lake and tries to recover her horse, but an engineer at work sees and fetches the horse then searches for its owner. And so is the romance born. Her husband sees that his rival has to win Eva, then decides to shoot himself later, but I thought that was rather illogical and his main weakness given his earlier loveless relationship with Eve. <br /> <br /> Although it's a 1990 reissue title on VHS, the sound is 70 years old, is a bit soft and crackles with background, in line with movies of his age. After a Time of Grief Our handsome friend is obviously so in love with Eve that he imagines her as a mother with a child, so we must assume that they live happily ever after in the late 1930s. This is a lyrical piece that can be enyoyed for its own sake and not just for its eye-catching title. I gave it 7/10."

Apart from the fighting scenes, some of the productions and special effects are primitive, apparently because most of the budget for this film was saved for the fight scenes, but for lovers of '60s cinema it should not be a problem.

But chaos ensues when a fraternity of geeks threatens to stop the debauchery and the Betas have to make a stand for their right to party.","To summarize this film: Without a real plot, this movie consists of 80 minutes of insane characters who either drink or make bad jokes. The music is just terrible, the humor is not funny and all female characters are kinky idiots or total geeks. It seems to me that the film was actually written by a 14-year-old boy who thinks drinking is cool, women are designed to please men, and anyone who opposes that view is geeks. Also, the movie has nothing to do with the original American Pie films except some names and Mr. Levenstein, who is a minor character in this movie. The only good thing about this movie are the good-looking girls. Do not look at this movie and do not be fooled by rating 5.4 as it's obviously overrated and does not earn anything over 2."
8,tt0404802,1,"Portrait of an American innocent. In 1955, Bettie Page (1923-2008 ) waits to testify before a Senate subcommittee investigating the effects of pornographic material on American adolescents and juveniles. In flashbacks, we see her childhood in Tennessee, a brief marriage, a gang rape, and her going to New York City in 1949. There she takes acting lessons, models for photos, and acts in short films for adults, earning the nickname, ""The Pin-Up Queen of the Universe."" We see her relationship with merchants Irving and Paula Klaw, photographers John Willie and Bunny Yeager, boyfriends, and the public. Through it all, she is wholesome, sporting, and forthright - Eve before the fall.","Firstly, I've heard great things about this movie, not least in the retro / vintage scene and the stocking lovers who love Bettie Page absolutely and did not disappoint. The film was shot in very clean black and white, with colors added for key scenes, giving Bettie Page's early life and career a documentary feel. <br /> <br /> There are many things I did not know about Page. First there was the gang rape, later there are her early attempts to develop an acting career and then glamor images, first with a camera populated with men who can not get enough of her and later with the Klaws, Paula and Irving, despite their bondage - and fetish photos act as extremely sympathetic and friendly people. If only modern porn producers were like that, maybe a better porn would be a consequence! For the most part, the film is not a slander against the evil of pornography, but an attempt to show the environment that existed in the 1950s for fetish and nude pictures of women. This environment was extremely repressive, perhaps in a good way, because it meant that there was no ""saturation effect"" that we have today when it comes to pornography. It also seemed a lot less hard. Page comes as someone who enjoys their work and does not seem to be mined by it. In many of her photos, she is seen tied up and gagged (and tries to make a conversation), swinging a whip with verve, thus arousing the photographers who take their pictures and girlie in the ""initiation style"" bondage movies that are pretty tame compared be with the hardcore stuff we have now. <br /> <br /> Page never became an actress and left pin-up when she was in her thirties for ""Jesus Christ."" Her belief in God and Jesus never goes away, even when bound and gagged, she still insists that she has received a ""gift"" from God to do ""that thing"". When I see this movie, I know more about Page and I am impressed with her modesty, her beliefs and her behavior. It's unique compared to the Identi-Kit clones we have today and those who can actually say, ""There's a life after porn."""
3,tt0845463,0,"King Higlack of the Gauths entrusts prince Finn and a fire ball weapon to his champion, slayer Beowulf. They lead twelve men on a mission to help king Hrothgar of the Danes, whose once glorious realm is terrorized by the undefeated monster Grendel. The task is made more difficult as Hrothgar kept gruesome secrets.","For starters, this is not nearly as bad as some of the other trash that the sci-fi channel produced; This does not mean that Grendel is a good movie, in fact he is very bad, but he definitely has the potential to be much better. The film's weaknesses are in character design, character, absurd additions to the story, the visual effects, the music and mostly the acting. <br /> <br /> When I talk about character design, of course, what our heroes and villains look like. Beowulf and the other Danes look more like ridiculous Vikings than warriors of brutal strength - this helmet our main character wears is just too silly. Grendel looks like the Hulk, but with strange tentacle attachments on his elbows. <br /> <br /> The characters are very limited. Beowulf is the same from start to finish, but Finn - a useless buddy - has achieved some two-dimensionality thanks to his romantic subplot, and Unferth also gets an idea as he becomes less conceited. <br /> <br Similar to Finn, there are useless additions to this story to make it your own while still clinging to the source material. The crossbow given to Beowulf is so ridiculous, I'm surprised that the cast did not go off the set. Besides additions, there are omissions, such as the underlying themes of Christianity and paganism, as well as the consequences of lying. <br /> <br /> The special effects are powerful awful. Grendel and his mother Hag are poorly designed, and as such, they are less credible on the screen. <br /> <br /> The music is overbearing, especially when a character dies. <br /> <br /> All in all, this is not the worst movie ever by Sci-Fi. No. It's actually one of the better movies, though it's still garbage, it's good garbage that at best makes it a guilty pleasure. The only thing that works is the dialogue, which is still wooden here and there. <br /> <br /> I recommend you skip this movie and see Robert Zemeckis' old story from Beowulf, simply because this movie (Grendel) is only half the story, and not the whole thing that makes this movie one Three star review receives."
3,tt0415778,0,A secret Service agent and a news reporter investigate the conspiracy behind the assassination of the President.,"Do not be fooled by all the big names like Burt Reynolds, James Woods and Anne Archer. They are just glorified extras. Her scenes were probably filmed in a day or so. Whatever your motives for this movie are, if you have an actor like James Woods you should use it better. For me, that's a sign of a bad direction through and through. The story itself was not that bad. And the action of most actors was above average. Cuba Gooding Jr., however, was terrible. He was so incredible that I almost laughed at his dramatic scenes. And since this was meant as a serious movie, that can not be good. The action scenes were not bad, but they lacked the special punch to make it more exciting. It was needed a better direction again. Even the pace was wrong for a movie like this. It took the main character almost half an hour to get going. This is way too slow for an action thriller of only 90 minutes. The only redeeming factor is Angie Harmon. She is doing her best to make everything work. Too bad the director let her down. Yes, this movie could have been much better with a great director. Andy Cheng is far too inexperienced as a director to pull it off. And for an action / stunt coordinator of his caliber, expect at least exciting action scenes. Do not waste your time with it. Avoid!"
10,tt0194218,1,"Alex, a sad-eyed mournful man, goes into psychotherapy: he discloses he's a hit man. He also tells the doctor, after a few sessions, that he's attracted to a young woman he's met in the waiting room. She's Sarah, 23, quick, edgy, and perhaps attracted to him as well. But he's married, the dutiful father of a young precocious boy, so Sarah brushes him off. In flashbacks we see him get his start as a killer, at his father's prompting: it's the family business. Dad gives Alex his next assignment: to kill the therapist. Alex keeps returning to Sarah, calling her, stopping by her apartment, as he decides what to do about the hit, his father, his marriage, and his malaise.","It is always sad when such films are overlooked by the majority of moviegoers. ""Panic"" is a wonderfully compelling and poignant study of a character who feels trapped in the futility of his own life. <br /> <br /> William H. Macy, like Alex, is as convincing as ever. This fine actor seems to have a special talent for pulling at your heart, no matter how flawed his characters may be; we may not always tolerate the lifestyles of the protagonists he plays, but the emotions of fear and confusion that he causes in us are often all too painfully familiar. The title ""panic"" seems paradoxical at first, given the lack of obvious emotions. At some point, Alex tells his doctor that he rarely gets angry. But as this story unfolds, it becomes more and more obvious that anger and despair, not indifference, are the driving forces behind this man's existence. <br /> <br /> More than once I was reminded of his performance in ""Fargo"". another strong drawing-driven movie. In ""Fargo"" and ""Panic"" we are witnessing a middle-aged man who somehow does not seem in tune with the rest of his life. He has lost his way, and the only way that seems deceptively back is darkness. He knows he makes bad decisions, but desperation overcomes self-control and common sense. <br /> <br /> Alex connects to Sarah, a 23-year-old woman (played by Neve Campbell), whom he meets in a doctor's office. Thematically this union is less coincidence, more the work of fate. Alex finds some comfort in Sarah, perhaps she senses that she is a companion like him, someone who has lost her way and hovers aimlessly through the rest of her life, waiting impotently for his inevitable conclusion. <br /> <Deciding on films like this one is a clever and compelling way for Neve Campbell to respond to critics who question her acting skills. Too often, it's the characters she's been playing, the weakness that gives Campbell no depth to play her theatrical muscles. However, this performance can be an eye-opener for many. <br /> <br /> In a perfect film world, there would not only be many more films like ""panic"", but they would also reach and be appreciated by a much wider audience. If you look at movies for the richness and depth of characterization, rather than just the latest state-of-the-art special effects, then ""panic"" is hard to miss. A +."

Devastated at the thought that Eddie has deserted her, she doesn't realize that Eddie has undergone a great change--one that will have a powerful impact on her.","I expected this movie to be an ordinary 1930s romance. Boy meets girls, they fall in love, boy loses girls, boy wins them in the end. It was not like that at all. Clark Gable plays the cheater Eddie with all his usual charisma and mischievous eyebrow lift. He hides from the police as he enters Ruby (Jean Harlow) 's apartment to see her covered in bubbles in the bathtub. Immediate chemistry. It's hard for a while, but a girl can only resist that grin for so long. The heat between them is obvious, and there are some scenes that are definitely pre-production code! When a blackmail job gets bad and Ruby ends up in a boarding house for ""restless girls,"" she is unhappy and, thanks to the fidget her roommate gives her, begins to believe that Eddie will never come for her. Harlow plays the hard-nosed, fast-talking Ruby perfectly. She never lets Gable get all the good lines!

When large parts of a public laugh and moan during and after a serious thriller, it is clear that the movie is hopeless. <br /> <br /> Not only that, it was also sick. The director took the plot for a fierce film beyond the boundaries of realistic fare and into the spheres of a blood-soaked B-movie. It's hard not to think of the director as a dirty old man, because the scale of the invisible man's out-of-lab trips to the outside world was just two attempts to feel some breasts. Maybe sex is the first thing you make invisible, but apart from the aesthetic pleasures of the women involved, it does not make entertaining movies. <br /> <br /> [follow spoiler] <br /> <br /> Go to the movies sick outside, and things are even worse. While Kevin Bacon does a fine job of increasingly filming himself as a ""hollow man,"" the others - perhaps hampered by a terrible scripture - do an even better job than a hollow cast. A longtime member of the team is found strangled by the invisible man in a locker. ""He's finally caught,"" shrugs a colleague without any trace of emotion. This is normal for the course, and the lab team fluctuates between sheer fear and utter indifference at such a speed that one wonders how they got into acting. They torture themselves fearfully through the lab corridors, the weapons are ready, but seconds later, one of the group members jumps happily down the corridor to fetch blood for an injured colleague. The senior woman treats the invisible with courtesy and good humor, even after he insults and abuses her, and there seems to be little response to his outbursts, even after drowning the Pentagon chief. ""He drowned in his pool last night"" the same woman, spectacularly failing to put two and two together. The script is littered with this kind of poorly-played pedestrian dialogue, and the rest is just an AZ of movie clichés that are thicker and faster when the movie gets to the point of complete Disbelief and amusement in the end progresses. <br /> <br /> The ""eureka"" moment on the computer, the female taking off at the window, the looped security video - the list is truly endless - the predictable disregard of strength in numbers, the decision not to kill the two main stars but to place her in a place of probable impending death and to leave her to herself, the nearly dead good guy who emerges from nothing to emerge the woman, the bomb and the ubiquitous land of Tdown-Timer, the fireball blast that just started before she reaches heroes, the falling lift that just stops before he meets her, and more than anything the immortality of evil. <br /> <br /> The invisible man was burned to pieces with an improvised flame thrower, beaten with electricity, hit with a bar around his head, who had just cut through one of the smaller actors, and then the blast, the fireball, and the total destruction of the laboratories apparently has survived, more than enough life is left to rise through the fireball for a last pop at the movie heroes - at which time the unbelieving onlookers writhe and watch their clocks. <br /> <br /> That this extraordinary bad movie actually made it!

This, of course, is the problem with what many believe to be an amazing book and turns it into a Disney TV movie. <br /> <br /> A Wrinkle in Time should have been made an amazing movie a long time ago. It has a great story that could appeal to children and adults. Plus it built quality continuations. But Disney crafting was not the way to go. The problem with the film is that all the things they've changed to turn it into a visual story have darkened what was so great about the book. It's a complicated and emotional story for kids. There was no reason to make Charles Wallace purely ""psychic"" because that was the easiest way to explain it. There was no reason to write a dispute between the three Mrs. Ws as extra tension, there is enough tension in the story without that. There was no reason to remove Meg's glasses ... that took us the scene, which is a very sweet scene between Calvin and Meg that appears in the book. <br /> <br /> I could nod for days about small things, but I also think bigger things, like the Art Direction was off. For example, let's see what Camazotz looks like with his strangely dark sky. The scary thing that appears in the book is that Camazotz could be Earth. It looks like earth. It has people who look like people. The sky is blue, the grass is green and children are playing. But something is a bit gone. The directors decided to make Camazotz a complete different one instead of taking the lesson in the book and applying it to the overall direction of the film. The lesson is of course that Camazotz could very well be the Earth if we forgot to love. It would have been a lot scary to spend a nice afternoon walking down the street while the kids hit the balls in the same rhythm. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, I did not pay attention to the end. Maybe someone can tell me that Disney messed up the end too. <br /> <br /> Overall, an artistic disappointment. <br /> <br />"

Granted, it's not a movie for everyone. There are no chases, no exploding buildings, no murders. The drama is in the tension that is unsaid by looks, minimal gestures, spatial boundaries, light and things - sometimes superficial. It's about identity, memory, community, belonging. The different parts of the film work together to reinforce the leitmotifs of self and other, identity, desire, limitations and loss. It will reward the attentive and sensitive audience. It will displease those whose palates require explosive, massive, spicy actions. It's a beautifully filmed human story. That's all."

Hickok meets Gen. George A. Custer that assigns Buffalo Bill to guide a troop with ammunition to help the fort. Meanwhile the Cheyenne kidnap Calamity Jane, forcing Hickok to expose himself to rescue her.","Sure, this movie is not historically accurate, but it's a great conversation. Most DeMille images, especially the later epics, are slow and cumbersome, but the plot moves here in a clip. The story is basically a series of peaks with very little quiet moments. The plot leads us from an Indian raid on a cabin; one of the best parts of the film awarded to Jean Arthur while trying to appease the indigenous war painting. After that, she and Cooper are taken to the war camp and tortured. Later comes a protracted battle with the Cheyenne. The whole thing is ridiculous, but very funny and entertaining from start to finish. Jean Arthur is one of the best actresses of this time and she shines here."

The refrigerator is spoken to as a character, as if standing in for absent nurturing from Woods' self-centered wife. The couple have two kids who must come of age as their home is being torn apart around them and the parents pursue fantasies of ""better things"" offered by crook Randy Quaid. Henry Thomas as the son copes by holding on to the land and creating a poetic commentary, and the responses of his sister to the crisis become a powerful and surprising tribute to womanhood.","2 stars out of a possible 10 - and that's overly generous. <br /> <br /> I thought with a cast of James Woods, Cathy Bates, Randy Quaid, Lou Gossett Jr. and Henry Thomas - how could it be missing. I was wrong. <br /> <br /> I'm just wondering what drug Sam Shepard was on the weekend when he was driving this piece of dribbling. I thought Sam S was crazy for a long time, this film, based on his playing, confirms it. <br /> <br /> This is the kind of artistic bs.s.

They also have mouths on them who utter words that make a sailor blush, especially the teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, as if that was not enough, the plot - and it's so skinny you could read it thoroughly - has a hole the size of Alaska. <br /> <br /> Ma is conspiring to sell her rundown farm. As it turns out, Pa is also. Now, I do not pretend to be a real estate expert, but the last time I checked, real estate that they have in common has to have both signatures to be sold. If only one of them owned the property, then the other could not legally sell it, so it would be pointless for that person to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this fundamental fact, and therefore his action does not work. <br /> <br /> Not that anything else really worked. <br /> <br /> The Only Possible Reason Someone Could See This movie is when they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity, and I can not imagine why anyone wants that ,"

Denver Pyle was a handsome man when he was young. John Dehner, Rod Taylor are outstanding in their roles. Sterling Hayden did the best he could with bad stuff.

The detailing of the security arrangements made by the SS on behalf of the President and the First Lady was also fascinating.

7,tt0495047,1,New Year's Revolution (2006) was the second annual New Year's Revolution pay-per-view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE).,"Not bad for Raw's first PPV of 006. But the end was really shocking for everyone present and those watching at home. <br /> <br /> FIRST GAME - RIC FLAIR VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR WWE INTERCONTINENTAL CHAMPIONSHIP Not a bad opener, these two can seriously play a great match if they have more time to compete in a wrestling match. Flair wins after Edge hits him with his MITB briefcase. 3/10 SECOND MATCH- TRISH STRATUS VS. MICKIE JAMES FOR THE WWE WOMEN'S CHAMPIONSHIP Not bad, considering these divas compete against each other for the first time in the ring. Mickie chooses a modified chick kick, but Trish ducks her own chick kick and wins it to keep her title. 3/10 THIRD MATCH TRIPLE H VS. BIG SHOW Really good, this match was real. The whole match HHH focuses on Big Show injured arm, but Big Show is still fighting back. Later, HHH is able to overthrow Big Show and get a pedigree for the win. 5/10 FOURTH MATCH SHELTON BENJAMIN W / MAMA VS. VISCERA {That was a bonus match} Not so bad, it was alright. After Viscera was down, Benjamin's mother got a purse {which had bricks in it} and hit Viscera three times with it. Viscera stood up, only to be caught by Benjamin for beating the tall man with a twisting heel kick. 4/10 <br /> <br /> FIVE GAME - JERRY 'THE KING' LAWLER VS. GREGORY HELMS Boring, slow and sloppy. Both men did not try very hard. Jerry Lawler wins after a fist drop for the win. 2/10 <br /> <br /> SIXTH MATCH TORRIES Wilson VS. VICTORIA VS. ASHLEY MARIA VS. CANDICE MICHELLE IN A FIRST WOMEN GAUNTLET MATCH It was quite entertaining for me. Ashley {I think} eliminates Candice last time to win the first women's Gauntlet match. 5/10 Seventeenth Match - John Cena VS. CHRIS MASTERS VS. CARLITO VS. SHAWN MICHAELS VS. KANE VS. KURT ANGLE W / DAIVARI IN A DISPOSAL CHAMBER MATCH FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP It was a cool knockout game. But nothing will surpass last year's eliminator, which was the best. The last three are Masters, Cena & Carlito. Carlito turns his back on Masters and gets a roll-up to eliminate him. A few seconds later, Cena gets a catch-up on Carlito to win the knockout and retain his WWE title. But his night was not over yet. 7/10 After the match comes Vince McMahon and congratulates Cena on his victory. Vince McMahon says his night is not over yet and says Edge is challenging money for the title in his Money In The Bank opportunity. Edge comes out with Lita, hands Vince the briefcase and goes into the ring when Cena has another match tonight. <br /> <br /> EIGHT MATCH - JOHN CENA VS. EDGE W / LITA FOR THE WWE CHAMPIONSHIP {Cena, who was acquitted during the Chamber match} is immediately hit by Edge, Edge then hits a spear on Cena, hits the cover & to his shock, Cena breaks out. Edge nails another spear & covers for the shocking three counts as he defeated Cena and won the WWE Championship for the first time in his career. 1/10 So the New Year's Revolution of last year was better than this year, but it was still alright. The European Championship match was also good and the shock from Edge taking his MITB opportunity is definitely the most shocking on the PPV show. <br /> <br /> Overall: I'll give it a 7/10 and a C"

In a spiraling tale of hatred, love and loyalty, two teenage friends realize that the only way for each of them to escape their miserable futures is by forever sacrificing the other.","You need to give this action sketch to any would-be filmmakers arriving at the bus station in Hollywood. Then they fill in the gaps and put their story in the city or ghetto they just came from. You know exactly what this film is about, from the opening shot, four young guys playing in grainy slow motion, accompanied by voice-over narrations. Next stop after the bus station must be to buy stock footage of four boys playing in grainy slow motion. Once they grow up, it's easy to spot the author / director among the four. He is the calm, thoughtful, long-haired one who is never seen in his pants without his composition book. This means his outstanding writing talent will be his ticket from Hickville to Hollywood. Only here there is no literary talent. And if you still can not figure out who he is, here's a clue: the author and his character have the same middle name. It took more than an hour to find out that those twenties were still in school. What looked like a prison was apparently a high school, the director was the director. Once again, the poor, misunderstood rebel can throw anyone in the movie on the sidewalk, murder and plunder, but is powerless against his alcoholic father. How about striking back, boy, how are you all the others? Numerous fistfighting scenes for no apparent reason. Howling bad dialogue. Many scenes are out of focus. Cartoon characters appear again and again as little players and extras and draw unintentional laughter from the premiere audience. Exaggerated in extreme cases. And if you do not fully understand the self-important speeches or the slow-motion scenes, just listen to the arrogant music. It will recognize you and what you should feel. Poor Marisa Ryan has to earn many frequent flyer miles as she travels across the country, working in these amateur regional films. The biggest sin is that the public should feel sympathy for children slaughtering old women, running, robbing and stealing puppies chained to a tree while complaining about their sad, sad life. But if we could just get out of this city and go to college. Yes, that's the ticket. Why does every twenty-year-old filmmaker believe that his life so far is so important and so interesting that the world can not wait to see it on screen? If this film is as autobiographical as it seems, then the author should better look over his shoulder for policemen who carry cursory arrest warrants."

I was sold on the promise of the action, with Segal and stealth planes that usually provide a fun action movie. I can honestly say that I would rather erase my eyes with a cocktail stick than have to see this movie again. The acting was so terrible that it was almost funny. The story was incredibly weak, with action holes so big that you could fly a F117 through them. The script was so bad when I found out that a 10-year-old wrote it, I should not be the least bit surprised. The direction and production is so amateurish, I would not even hire these people to shoot my worst enemies wedding video. Utter Utter. Those responsible for this film have cheapened the art and they should be ashamed of themselves.

Claw's plan is to thwart Gadget once and for all by using a newer ""cooler"" criminal investigator to destroy Gadget's popularity.

Without the voice of Don Adams as Inspector Gadget, it just does not cut anymore; Dr. Not only is Claw visually less scary, he sounds more like a cold-blood wrestler than his original intimidating self.

Someone has also decided to update Penny to bring her two decades up, she now has a rebellious clothing style quasi-punky and does not play half the role she has played in the TV series. The gadget mobile speaks, as well as a plot-angle focusing on talking cars.

Even a stupid child, though the plot was stupid and a bit boring, if the killer did not use his light meter to kill people. What baffles me is that the film has a very solid cast. What kind of script did they read when they agreed to be in this movie, as it's safest to be boring and just a means to show a small saber on a small scale. The plot is sometimes incomprehensible and the end is totally chaotic. The whole movie seems to be about aliens and guns. The plot has two children and a guy who has an alien encounter flashes years later and there seems to be a return, sort of in the mix. To explore dead animals and such and for some reason the one guy gets the weapon of the aliens and continues to use them to go on a very light rampage.

I agree with that. But we love the adaptations of great literature, and the writers' recent strike reminds us that without good writers, it's hard for actors to bring their roles to life. The current version of Jane Austen's PERSUASION shows us what happens if you do not have a good foundation in a well-written adaptation. This version is not comparable to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, which was well played and retained the essence of the era and the limitations of the characters (with the exception of the bizarre parade and kissing in the street scene in Bath). , The 2007 version features a Twitty Anne who seems to be scared. The other characters were not very developed, which is a crime, considering how Austen could paint such wonderful characters with carefully chosen understatements. The sequence of events that made sense in the novel has been jumbled and Mrs. Smith, Anne's bedridden and impoverished schoolmate, walks around in Bath - chirping, as many of the characters seemed to do. The strength of the character and the intelligence of Captain Wentworth, which made Anne love him at all, did not seem to be written in the Wentworth by Rupert Penry-Jones. Ciaran Hinds had more substance and at one glance could convey so much more than P-J could do with his poses. All in all, the 2007 version was a disappointment. It seemed to make the novel questionable in a tangible, costumed melodrama. If they wanted to bring our modern emotional extravaganza into Austen's work, they should have done what they do with adaptations of Shakespeare: adapt them to the present. At least ""Bride & Prejudice"" was taken out of the historical and locational settings and was fun to watch, as was ""Clueless"".

All these unscheduled storylines and jokes make it completely meaningless to me whether the criminal gets caught or not. We have already forgotten the murder story at this point or not, because several storylines and feasts of the chases have stunned us beyond comprehension. <br /> <br /> While I could go over the chases and how you could ruin a decent story, I will not do it. This could have been a very pleasant formula film, but it was far too big for his breaks and it became a waste of time.

Reality television, hardly, but if you are addicted to the contestants, locals or competition, this is your cup of tea. If you dont, this whole series is dripping as I say, dripping with sauce. It's another show that hides behind the reality label. That's the trend that started in 2000. <br /> <br /> It's smooth and well produced, so it might take a while. After all, even repeats of Gilligan's Island, Green Acres, Beverly Hillbillies and The Brady Bunch. This only deals with professional actors. The intelligence is about the same."

Now humans and vampires can coexist in harmony, and even form relationships. But there will always be rogue elements on both sides ready to exploit the uneasy truce.","Man, I find it really hard to believe that the wonderful Alan Ball had something to do with this mess. Having seen the first two episodes so far, I can safely say that this show is not on my list. It just has so many things working against it. <br /> <br /> No actor is particularly good. Anna Paquin as the main character Sookie, is just terrible. I remember she was better at many other things I saw her in, maybe it's just writing. It's also no fun to look at her, there are moments when she honestly looks ugly. The actor playing Bill is marginally better, if only because his character is supposed to be somehow wooden and aloof. The other actors do their best, but with the clichés of hard-to-apply accents, it's a tough job. Tara is an absolute misery, Rutina Wesley absolutely kills the accent. It's bad like nails on a blackboard. Almost as horrible is Nelsan Ellis, it's hard to understand what he sometimes says. Both his character and Taras seem a bit racist to me. I do not know to have a character who says why I'm on a HBO show that is not The Wire just seems a bit strange. The cast is Sookie's grandmother, her sex-addicted brother, and the only ingenious cast I've ever seen as Sheriff in William Sanderson. <br /> <br /> The story seems to meander in this direction at this point, no real worry about keeping the viewer interested. The love stuff is very Dark Shadow-sy. Although the camp factor of something like these old Dark Shadows episodes increases by ten. Sometimes it felt so great that I just had to assume that it should be so. But unlike a show like Buffy, which has finished the camp masterfully, that's not the case. Not with the Campiness is the extreme gore and graphic sex of the show. I am not averse to these two, if they are well done, as they have done in many other HBO shows, but here they have at least prolonged the hard sex scenes with Jason Stackhouse, which seem a bit over the top and pointless. <br /> <br / The only good thing I can really say about this mess is that I liked the opening title sequence. HBO has had a lot of bad luck with their shows lately, I hope they will cancel after the first season and try to get something better on air."

There was character development (and Charlie is the epitome of dynamic character), plot development, great animation, emotional involvement and a rational, relatable and consistent theme. If not for the handful of song-and-dance routines, you would never have thought that this was a children's movie, and that's why I give it such a high rating. This movie is an excellent movie, let alone a children's movie. Which brings me to my second point: this must be the darkest ""kids"" movie I've seen in a long while, a 22-year-old. I would be shocked if a child under the age of eight in the second half and in the first half of the movie were not completely scared and it ends with one of the saddest ends ever encountered (aka ""Jurassic Bark"") you guys who are 'Futurama' fans) and that makes this movie so good. Just because the film generally arouses emotions that we do not usually like to feel and accept are bad, does not make the movie itself bad; in fact it means that it has succeeded. Good funny movies should make us laugh; good horror movies should scare us; good sad movies should make us sad. My point is, good movies should move you, not just entertain you; this movie has moved me. <br /> <br /> Also, this film is incredibly violent by today's standards for a children's film and contains topics that are not suitable for some children by today's standards. Parents, I would say look at it first. I'm not usually there to say anything, but I saw it yesterday and it even came as a surprise to me."

After learning the Shinobi arts in China for 17 years, Venus has returned to New York. The Turtles are now faced with new villains such as Dragon Lord, Bonesteel and Vam Mi.","Sometime in 1998, Saban had acquired the rights to produce a brand new Ninja Turtles action series. Of course, since I was a fan of the TMNT at the time, it obviously caught my interest. When I started watching the show ... to say that I was disappointed with the end result is an understatement. Some time later (more like recently), I had a chance to revisit the series. <br /> <br /> First, let's talk about some of the positive things. They managed to render the Turtles' Cave, as it was last seen in the movies, relatively well, given the limited budget they provided. There is a tendency for this gloomy atmosphere regarding the sets and so on. And the turtle suits, though not the biggest piece of puppetry and whatever, were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series. <br /> <br /> People tend to complain about getting rid of Shredder quickly and replacing him with those original villains that could easily be used in a Power Rangers show. But you can only beat Shredder until it gets boring and undermines its value as a villain ... and besides, most fans do not know, or do not remember or just ignore the fact that they're in the original comic Shredder was in the very first issue! Forget the countless resurrections that would follow. From a personal point of view, I was somehow glad that they got rid of Shredder, because then the anticipation grew to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode. I think Shredder works best in small quantities, because then his encounters with the Turtles are all the more memorable. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they replace him with those original villains who, as I said, seemed more suited to a Power Rangers show than a Ninja Turtles show. And with these new magically swinging generics comes a new female, magically swinging turtle, the infamous Venus De Milo. I will be honest; I never made friends with her. I am not against the idea of ​​a female turtle; I'm only against the idea of ​​someone who uses magic, and thus stands out as a wild sight in a clan of ninja turtles who seem to be a little out of their domain. I almost have the impression that this could have been the Venus De Milo show dealing with their supposed enemies, and the TMNT are just there to deliver the star power (or whatever, given the time frame left over) remained). Fortunately, they all share the limelight. <br /> <br /> Next Mutation was aired after a season, and the creators were more than happy to ignore it. Given the time and maybe another season, I really believe that this live iteration of the TMNT could have been something and maybe got a shot at size. But while the idea was solid, the execution was flawed (though there are some good episodes in this series). As it stands, Next Mutation is one of those curiosities in Turtledom that is best buried and forgotten."

Screen it for someone who is not old enough to see it originally aired and see the reaction you get (warning - reactions from such people range from horrified looks to tummy tears). <br /> <br /> According to the trivial department for This Mini - Dan Curtis himself chose Ali MacGraw and Robert Mitchum.

This thing was dated the minute it was completed. <br /> <br /> These two minis were great, as an original show and to those of us who saw them, pulling on a nostalgic string that reminds us of a younger day.

Emphasis is also placed on several inside story episodes, where events are covered which occurred inside Germany and Japan such as resistance to Hitler, life in general under a dictatorial regime, and particular emphasis is focused on the Jewish Holocaust.","The music and dark interpretation of Laurence Olivier perfectly set the tone for this outstanding documentary. This is still a must for WW II buffs, descendants of the participants in this conflict, politicians who think things always go their way when they expand their foreign policy on the deck of an aircraft carrier (do you hear that George Bush?) And everyone others who are curious or need to know why a particular aspect of this conflict occurs. The 26 episodes are roughly in chronological order, but can be seen out of sequence, as they are more or less independent. For the new viewer, there will be a new realization due to the sheer volume. Actual images of the battles are interspersed with interviews of the participants of the stories. Many of the interviews are with second-line authorities, that is, staff to assist the main characters, soldiers, captains, secretaries, eyewitnesses and the like. You get a real taste of what war is all about. <br /> <br /> I'm watching the DVD version of the original TV documentary. I strongly recommend it over the worn, gaptoathed, overpriced VHS listings on eBay. I paid 120 cdn for five 2-sided DVD discs. This new version includes bonus material and is in full screen mode. The menus are easy to follow, there is first a selection of which episode you want to watch and then, once you have chosen, you are given the opportunity to play different chapters in the episode or to play the whole episode. It is understandable with such a comprehensive presentation that there is a tiny amount more navigation in the menu, but the impact of what you will see is not diminished after 30 years, no, after 60 years since the end of the war. <br /> <br /> I remember watching the first show on the Buffalo PBS Station just before I left London in 1975, and from that point on I wished I could have a copy.

It seems that most of the really big noirs of the last two or three decades have taken place in the south, where the men are glittering and the ladies, uh, are also glittering. Why? Because it is hooooottttttttttt. And everyone looks better wet (at least the men do - sweaty women leave me clammy). Anyway - there could be some spoilers. <br /> <br /> This movie is a wonderful example of everything a Noir should be - steady pace (though some with attention disorders call it ""slow""), clear and broad (though not simple) characters, and tons of atmosphere. No, if anything, it's about moods and attitudes. That's why the big guys are not marked by their traditional definitions of ""great"" acting (look at Bogart, Mitchum, Hurt and Nicholson - they (and their characters) were anything but real - but they had style and hatred and in a crime Movie, that's exactly what you want). or quick adventures (again, all the big noirs seem to burn slowly like a cigarette). Big noirs create an environment and you only live with the characters for a few hours. <br /> <br /> After Dark My Sweet let it go - and be entertained by some very interesting and complex characters. Uncle Bud and Collie are intriguing - they never allow the audience to know what's really driving them - and Patric and Dern (I love Bruce Dern, by the way) are pitch perfect, especially Dern (see previous comment). They take the characteristics of a character and give them depth and our sympathies. <br /> <br /> The story itself is also interesting. There are better plots in the world of Noir (hardly a secret here - mostly it's tension), but this one is solid. If anything, the simple ""good"" plot has more to do with Jim Thompson's writing than anything else. At Thompson, land is almost secondary; he has avoided the labyrinthine tales of Hammett and Chandler for simpler stories with stronger, confusing characters. Watch a novel like The Killer Inside Me and you'll see straight away (what it's about). When it comes to Thompson, that's not what it's about, it's what it's about (to quote Roger Ebert). So, really, the relatively simple act of kidnapping is not the point and, if you do not like it, well the jokes about you. <br /> <br /> Why is this an 8-star movie instead of a 10-star movie because of the female lead role. It's not bad, per se, but it's not Angelica Huston or Anette benning (see the adaptation of Jim Thompson's The Grifters, if you do not know what I'm talking about - besides, it's a better movie and you should start with contemporary Noir - It's the best of the 1990s and challenges Blood Simple to the title of the best since Chinatown - she just does not have the chops (or the looks for that matter) and though she and Patric have some chemistry, I do not have it with her. Well there."

For the other part, this film is a really bad and lame, with a small budget, offensive badly written script and everything that goes with it. <br /> <br /> It's silly that with all the money in Christian circles never seem to get enough money to make a decent movie. I'm not a religious spirit, so I really do not care, but filmmaking is a good tool to reach a new audience for the churches and make people more interested and curious about reading the bible, for example. In this regard, these films always seem to be a missed opportunity. <br /> <br /> The low budget really hurts the movie and brings it down. It makes the movie ridiculous to see with its effects, and it gives the entire movie a beefy B-movie-like feel. <br /> <br /> But what hurts this movie more is its writing. The stuff that's just going on in this movie is just insulting to the intelligence and then I'm not complaining or talking about the religious aspects of the whole story. The way the movie progresses is unlikely and the people in this film are doing so highly unlikely things to offend their viewers. <br /> <br /> I also hated how the movie was sometimes like a soap opera. It seemed to me that they just had a hard time making a full-length movie out of it, and they added characters and dramatic developments just to fill things up. That just did not really bother me. <br /> <br /> Still, it has to be said that as the story gets more focused on the basics, the movie becomes firmer and more enduring. Still, it remains predictable, but it has prevented this movie from being a total wreck that you can see, and as far as those kinds of movies are concerned, there are far worse things to look at, though I do not think that one Film will win any new souls. <br /> <br /> 4/10"

In addition, there seem to be many questionable legal aspects about what Tritter actually does. He alone can not freeze accounts and have the authority to prevent doctors writing prescriptions for patients. Much of the vindictiveness he shows hurts the very sick patients in the hospital and that's not a good story to portray.

That's because I like crazy foreign comedies - especially the weird ones that totally surprise you. Although these were often surprised, these were almost never pleasant surprises. It reminded me of South Park, where almost every social norm was violated, until the only ones left were too sick to be weird.

That's right, a short, a fat, a slimmer or whatever it is. <br /> <br /> I'm not sure where to start my review. Well, me 'I was in my late teens and never was a fan of Roald Dahl, but I like his material well enough after reading some of his books as a kid and Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory have seen again and again. However, this film is fighting for an audience. Is it aimed at children? Adult? I'm still uncertain! Many of the ""jokes"" would give birth to a child, especially since Mr. Fox, for example, visits a lawyer or complains about being poor. In addition, an audience of (I assume) children is expected to sympathize with a character who steals and kills chickens. I'm all for the food chain, but you can practically see Mr. Fox biting his neck! Surely that's a bit much? And also the plot ... well, it's kind of boring. I only stayed hoping it would get better, but instead I became more and more annoyed with Mr. Fox and his son Ash for making stupid decisions. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile the humor is falling. I only laughed once or twice, although I have explicitly recognized attempts by jokes. I think part of it is that the voice is so incredibly flat and monotone. The speakers have no sense of weird timing, but aim at the subtlety of humor that only works with certain media. George Clooney aims to portray Mr. Fox as charming and elegant, but his voice has no character. Meryl Streep shows no emotion, I did not even realize that Bill Murray played a role until the end of the credits, and Ash, twelve years old in Fox Years, sounds like he's about 30. <br /> <br /> I love Animation, especially stop-motion, but the visual style has circled me a bit. Characters are tall, spiked and without any warmth of design. They move with very little fluid and often the animation is jerky and weird. There is also a pronounced ""mixed medium"" as sporadic and unsuccessful 2D components are added. Characters look directly into the camera and talk; it was very embarrassing. There were a moment or two when Kylie looked straight into the camera, did not move and whirled on his eyeballs. It really scared me. <br /> <br /> Fantastic Mr. Fox had so much potential.

Kol meets up with some teens and Ward Armstrong and together they all try not to get killed by the pursuing Woman of Death - The Alienator.,"I do not know what this other meeting talked about. This is definitely not a bimbo movie, in fact I do not think there was a decent-looking girl in it. No, it's just cheesy, badly done, Ed Wood-style science fiction. And it is bad. I can not even tell you how bad it is. I saw it on the cable late at night and I was shocked. The fact that this film was ever released is an insult to us all. The actors were either friends of the producer or mentally retarded, the special effects are a joke, and the tempo is insanely slow. For me, music is the most important thing. A monkey could write a better topic with a toy xylophone. Do not rent this thing, but if you ever see it on cable, watch it. You'll be amazed how bad a movie can be."

He has also had no luck with women largely due to the sheltered life he's led under the wings of his overbearing mother. His lack of encounters with women in the sexual sense is unlike his brash cousin, Sgt. Danny Bonhoff, who will do anything and take whatever opportunity to be up close and personal with the opposite sex. With Danny's help, Lionel is able to lose his virginity, although it isn't a totally satisfying experience. Regardless, Lionel learns that the reason for his nausea and vomiting following that encounter is because he got pregnant from it, he being the first male in recorded history to be so. By this time, he and one of his students, Russian gypsy Segoynia Savaka, have fallen in love and want to get married. They have to decide what to do about the baby. But the infamy and notoriety...","I'm pretty sure this was the worst movie ever. If you can not get a 13-year-old boy to laugh at silly humor, you should give up the comedy forever. Unfortunately Joan Rivers has chosen differently. The movie is full of predictable gags (some of them are racist) and very funny jokes. Especially noteworthy is the scene in which the doctor tells the main character that the rabbit has died and he is pregnant (as I write this I can not believe that this was actually a movie scene). The man hurries to a dead rabbit on the doctor's desk and tries to give it mouth to mouth. ROTFLMAO! NOT! The punchline that can tell you how bad things are in this movie is, ""I knew I should be up there."" ha ha ha ha ah ............"

Impulse, Arthur Curry (Aquaman) and Victor Stone (Cyborg) return to Smallville to help him take down LuthorCorp's secret lab called 'Project 33.1'. During a break-in at the LuthorCorp facility, Bart is captured and tortured by Lex for information to who hired him. Clark sets off to rescue him but is felled by kryptonite. An alarmed Chloe goes to Oliver for help, and the newly formed ""justice league"" springs into action to rescue Clark and Bart. Meanwhile, Oliver painfully decides to break up with Lois, feeling that his dedicating to justice is more important, but he leaves out that information from her.","This particular episode of Smallville is probably the best episode since reunification. This is for many reasons. For example, it brings the series back to some of its roots. He greets Lionel from a supposedly long absence with the Luthorcorp Plaza office in Metropolis. This room was not in Smallville for a very long time, and when we see it again, it brings back many of the memories of the Smallville's past. Not to mention, Lionel's conversations with Lex are always admirable. <br /> <br /> Another pleasant return is, as you can imagine, Bart Allen (aka Impulse), AC (aka Aquaman) and Victor Stone (aka Cyborg). Steven Deknight not only unites the former Justice leaguers, he adds them to the Smallville formula in a unique way, making it almost as if it were a full-length movie. <br /> <br /> From there you get the Basic Story, Green Arrow makes the league, tries to blow up 33.1, Bart is captured, Clark rescues him and the plant is blown in Kingdom com. Everything is good and graceful, with a good mix of stealth, action, pace and tension. Oh, and Cyborg has some cool new upgrades that match the character of the Justice League :) <br /> <br /> The music is probably the reason why this episode works so well. If you remember correctly, the first episode starring Steven Deknight was Season 4 Agless. This was a mediocre episode, but something felt out of place. Maybe it was the music, or the acting, or the fact that in the end ""we did not find you, you found us"", somehow people lost faith in the formula. But thankfully, Steve Deknight has delivered in this righteous episode. <br /> <br /> I had a few thoughts of Justice, who managed to miss the full 10. Especially the far too cheesy outcome of the Justice League expanding the Ridge facility. I mean, it would have been so much cooler if Green Arrow and Cyborg had started on Oliver's bike (remember the arrow episode). Clark and Impulse should have obviously been running, and Aquaman should have swum across another path. But that was so unbelievably cheesy that it removed 2 points from the full 10 points. <br /> <br /> Second time another cheesy moment, not as bad as the first, but when Green Arrow says ""Let's go, save the world"". That made me flinch. All in all, judging by the theatrical performances, the music, the directing and production values, the pros outweigh the cons, and this is still one of the best episodes in Smallville's history, and perhaps the second-best episode in Season 6 br /> <br /> 7 out of 10 ..."

Bad audience; We were first trapped in something that seemed like a really beautiful and romantic story, just to be led back and forth into the dark reality of the mismatch. These two boys just did not belong to their first ambiguous encounter. As much as Mathieu and Cedric were sexually attracted to each other, the lack of a deeper emotional bond made it impossible for Mathieu, an intellectual being, to meet someone whose sensitivity was more attuned to carnival celebrations and fanfare. <br /> <br /> Technically, I loved the camera in this movie. Subtitles were completely unnecessary, even though my French is ""presque rien"". I could see it again without the annoying English translation and enjoy it even more.

I would have expected that from a ""new"" Steven Segal movie, not from this one ... The main actress makes me think about artificial suntan, dyed hair and too much foundation! And I have not seen a scene where her hair is messed up or she is sweating or her clothes are dusty. She just does not look like a 19th century woman!

It's like one of those Lifetime movies that are ""based on a true story,"" but completely invented. there is nothing of the emotion or depth of the book, only mindless melodrama.

3,tt0024675,0,"The two lovers are living together and are not married as they hesitantly explain to her brother. They had made a promise as children to get married when they grew up, but they ""didn't wait."" It's an important plot point as it drives Cooper's actions when he discovers that Crawford and Young are living in sin.","In his first screenplay, based on his own short story ""Turn About,"" William Faulkner delivers a bizarre story of loyalty, sacrifice, and truly strange relationships. The story was originally only about the characters Tone, Young and Cooper, but MGM had to put Joan Crawford in a different picture to fulfill their contract, and Faulkner committed himself by creating a female role. Crawford insisted that their lines be written in the same capricious style as the Young and Tone of their co-stars, leading to unintended hilarity as these three communicate in a telegraph-like shorthand that sounds like a Monty Python sketch (""Wuthering Heights "") in semaphore). Seriously, the almost completely unfamiliar sentences make Ernest Hemingway read like Henry James. <br /> <br /> The film also reflects some familiar Faulkner themes, with an almost unnaturally close relationship between brother and sister (as in his ""sanctuary"" and elsewhere.) As Young Crawford suggests in Tones present instead of an engagement ring, THE THREE of them share their engraved childhood rings, the closeness of Tone and Young is also remarkable, especially when they look at the fate of Thelma & Louise, to be honest, it's scary. <br /> <br Not so scary to that New Yorker, however, as the recurrent theme of the massive cockroach, Wellington, who catches Crawford happily (and who passes over her hands - I'm shown playing) had to turn away!) And Young becomes a gladiator. Sheet. <br /> <br /> That means there are some nice performances. Young is particularly involved in a scene where he was inducted into Cooper's fighter plane, and Roscoe Karns is adorable as Cooper's flying buddy. Ton, despite his inability to express himself through realistic dialogue, has a nice moment and throws his own stealthy tears over the fate of his young mate. Crawford, even without meaningful dialogue, usually works either wooden or melodramatic, which is a balancing act for a role. <br /> <br /> The battle scenes - not surprisingly, for a Howard Hawks movie - are the most exciting part of the whole picture. But not enough. As far as I'm concerned, that's 75 minutes of my life. I will never come back again."

Without Robin Williams it would have gone straight to the video. It is badly written. It is badly aligned. Worse, it's an interesting topic, making it a ridiculous and boring thriller that has no tension and no inner or emotional logic. Especially after the first half hour, the film fits into a series of ridiculous set pieces. This is so exaggerated that the audience with whom I saw it had to laugh about it. Save your money. The trailer is totally misleading - it's not exciting and there's no thrill - in fact, the movie is the worst offense that it's just boring."

But a nasty piece of news hits the human resistance: 250,000 machine sentinels are digging to Zion and would reach them in 72 hours. As Zion prepares for the ultimate war, Neo, Morpheus and Trinity are advised by the Oracle to find the Keymaker who would help them reach the Source. Meanwhile Neo's recurrent dreams depicting Trinity's death have got him worried and as if it was not enough, Agent Smith has somehow escaped deletion, has become more powerful than before and has chosen Neo as his next target.","`The Matrix 'was an exciting summer blockbuster that was visually awesome, but also curious in its' Twilight Zone' style. This is the general rule - and this sequel does not fit with its predecessor. Worse than that, it's not even comparable to it. <br /> <br /> `Reloaded 'explodes on the screen in the most unprofessional way. In the first few seconds, the first impression is generally good as Trinity is shot in a dream. Immediately thereafter, the film appears in the nose. After catastrophic first 45 minutes, it gradually gains momentum as it enters the Matrix and the fight with Agent Smith takes place. But it loses all speed when it reaches the 14-minute chase sequence and gets even worse at the big moan-worthy spin. The worst part is the overlong ""Zion Rave"" scene. Not only does it have absolutely nothing to do with the storyline, it is also a pathetic apology for porn and depressive dance music. <br /> <br /> The bullet-time aspect of `The Matrix 'was a good match, but in' Reloaded 'they use too much to make it look boring. In the first case there were interesting plot turns, but here it is too linear to be interesting. The movie is basically just a series of stylish distractions that keep us from seeing how empty they really are. It works on the wrong principle that bigger is better. It seems that `The Matrix` franchise quickly drank into the special effects of misfire, the other franchises such as the 'Star Wars' saga have dropped. <br /> <br /> The acting standard is usually poor. The best character of course is Hugo Weaving's ""Agent Smith"" - the only one who is a little interesting. Keanu Reeves is the definitive neo, but in all the special effects there is little room to make a big impact. Oscar nominee Laurence Fishburne becomes a monotonous mentor with poor dialogue. Carrie Ann Moss's role as an action chick could have been made much better by any other actress. <br /> <br /> A poor, ragtag movie, `The Matrix Reloaded 'is a disappointment. Those who did not like the first one will probably not flock around. This is only for diehard fans. Even in the own subgenre of the Bonanzas (Minority Report, The Matrix, etc.) that is still quite poor. My IMDb Rating: 4.5 / 10."

Anyway, back to Get a Clue! I've seen some episodes and expected something very good, but from what I've seen, I was not impressed at all. Most of all, I hated the animation. It was flat, deflated and very Saturday morning cartoon standard, easily the worst aspect of the series. Even some shows that I really hate had a slightly better animation. Worse, Shaggy and Scooby looked aliens, and I missed Fred, Velma, and Daphne a lot because they added a lot to the old episodes when Scooby Doo was positively good. I also hated the character change because it looked like Shaggy and Scooby were now playing superheroes instead of them in the movies or Scooby Doo Where Are You? Show. The theme of tune was also not very good, I can not even remember it, and the jokes were lame and fictional. Although I acknowledge that there is a very talented voice, they would have had better material and it would not have been said that it sounds so different from the original voices as humanly possible, what they did I might add.

The script itself was very good together. <br /> <br /> I had seen Moore and Harper in other films in recent years and found them very good. But I had no idea that they worked so well as a team. While both actresses do their part in fulfilling the title of this film, they never seem to let me down. (During the course of this movie.) Joie Lenz and Marisa Ryan play their roles okay, but nothing great. The rest of the cast like Jonah, Cecile and ... everyone else works well together. <br /> <br /> As it is a reunion, one would expect a fan of one of the shows to enjoy it. From a non-fan I still enjoyed this little meeting. Good storylines for every character and the two main characters make this movie very good.

And why was Coes brother, Brisbane Coe, found dead in the cupboard on the ground floor? <br /> <br /> The now 73-year-old Kennel Murder Case still offers a stylish look at the old classic thriller. What makes it as good as it is is, first, the mystery is complicated and smart, but still logical. Second, William Smith's amusing, safe performance. Consider his work as Philo Vance as a sort of rehearsal for his great accomplishments as Nick Charles. Few things escape Vance. He uses his mind to put things together. He is also a good company. Powell was a star in the twenties and was steadily moving in status and popularity as the tape took over. His intelligence, style and effortless sophistication have made him one of the most contemporary actors of the past. <br /> <br /> Pleasant are also some other great faces. There is Mary Astor as Hilda Lake, the young, vindictive and potentially rich community of Coe; Paul Cavanaugh as titled Briton hovering around Hilda; Helen Vinson in her most sultry and selfish manner (look at Vogues in 1938 for what she really does); Etienne Giraudot, a little older man than the fussy Dr. Doremus, whose work as a coroner and coroner always takes him away from his meals; and Ralph Morgan as private secretary to Archer Coe.

So many of the events just felt totally random and sudden. <br /> <br /> I suppose there was studio noise or something, because the biggest problem I have with the movie is the fact that the story looks big and epic, but it all happens fast and passes so fast. I feel like I've just been hit with a million plots and action sequences in a big ball. The film is like a slap in the face. It does not take much time to establish characters or drama. Imagine the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy in 90 minutes. You could have most of the epic battle sequences, but there would be absolutely no build up and you would hardly care about the outcome of those battles. That was the case with Dragon Wars? 90 minutes where I do not give a damn and wait for it to be over. <br /> <br /> Fantastic CGI with reasonably good direction, but terrible acting, fast tempo and a stupid story made it very hard to enjoy for any reason. I probably loved it when I was 6."
9,tt0032155,1,"Ten years in the life of Abraham Lincoln, before he became known to his nation and the world. He moves from a Kentucky cabin to Springfield, Illinois, to begin his law practice. He defends two men accused of murder in a political brawl, suffers the death of his girlfriend Ann, courts his future wife Mary Todd, and agrees to go into politics.","The young Mr. Lincoln is the first film of the director / star collaboration of John Ford and Henry Fonda. I remember Fonda telling years ago that, as a young actor, he was understandably nervous about playing Abraham Lincoln, and was afraid he would not live up to the challenge. <br /> <br /> John Ford reassured him before shooting He said he would not play the Great Liberator but only a prairie lawyer. That decided Fonda headed a cast that turned John Ford into a classic movie. <br /> <br /> This is not a biographical film by Lincoln. This was previously in the sound era with Walter Huston and a year after Young Mr. Lincoln, Raymond Massey had the Pulitzer Prize winner piece by Robert Sherwood Abe Lincoln in Illinois. Massey still remains the final Lincoln. <br /> <br /> But as Ford said, Fonda did not play the Great Liberator, just a small city lawyer in Illinois. The film covers about 10 years of Lincoln's early life. We see him working in a grocery store and getting a few law books from an immigrant pioneer family whose path he would cover later in history. And his romance with Ann Rutledge's early death, which makes Lincoln a melancholy creature. <br /> <br /> Nearly 10 years later, Lincoln is now a practicing lawyer who is beginning to make himself felt. He has spent a few semesters in the legislature, but he's back in private practice, not really sure if politics is for him. <br /> <br /> This is where most of the action takes place. The two sons of this family had received the law books of that time when they were charged with murder. He offers to defend her. And not an ordinary murder, but one of a deputy sheriff. <br /> <br /> The process itself is fiction, but the Gambit defended in the defense of Richard Cromwell and Eddie Quillan, who played the two sons, based on a true Lincoln case. I will not say more. <br /> <br /> Apart from the performances, Young Mr. Lincoln's great strength is the way John Ford captures the mood and atmosphere of a small prairie town in Illinois in a Fourth of July celebration. It's almost like watching a newsreel. And it was the mood of the country itself, young, alive and growing. <br /> <br /> Fans of John Ford movies will recognize two musical themes that have been repeated in later films. During the romantic interlude at the beginning with Fonda and Pauline Moore, who played Ann Rutledge, the background music is the same theme as in The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance for Vera Miles. And at a dance, the tune Lovely Susan Brown, the Fonda, and Marjorie Weaver, who plays Mary Todd, is the same thing that Fonda danced with Cathy Downs, in My Darling Clementine's dance for the reanimation of a church in Tombstone. <br /> <br /> Lincoln will forever be a favorite subject of biographers and playwrights, for two reasons, I believe. The first is that he is the living embodiment of our own American mythology of people who, through their own efforts, ascend from the bottom up to the height of power. In fact, the young Mr. Lincoln vividly shows the background from which Lincoln came. And second, the fact that he was our president during the biggest crisis in American history and that he made a unique good and moral decision to free slaves during the Civil War, albeit for some political reasons. His assassination has secured his place in history. <br /> <br /> In addition to Fonda and others I've mentioned, Fred Kohler, Jr. and Ward Bond, the two city thugs, Kohler as a murder victim and Tie the main prosecutor. Also Donald Meek as prosecutor and Alice Brady in their last movie as pioneering mother of Cromwell and Quillan. And a very nice performance by Spencer Charters, who specializes in rustic characters as judges. <br /> <br /> For a movie that captures the drama and romance of the time he plays, you can not be better than Young Mr Lincoln."

Rose takes charge and tries to find a way to get everyone out safely. The Doctor and Ida have descended 10 miles into the bowels of the planet only to find themselves trapped there and unable to return to the surface. They find evidence of a ancient civilization and a seemingly bottomless pit where the doctor confronts the beast and finds the solution. The only problem is that the solution may kill Rose.,"The Impossible Planet and The Satan Pit together comprise the two best episodes of the ""new"" Doctor Who's second season. Having said that, it should be obvious that much of the story transposes the storyline of Quatermass and the Pit (1967) into an outer space situation, where the story of the universe is intertwined with that of Beast 666. Relationships between Rose and the Doctor while she too Highlight Roses' increasing self-confidence and establish her as a not-quite-equal partner with our beloved Time Lord. Also noteworthy is Matt Jones' elegant script, which reduces the occasional over-reliance on one-liners for the doctor and the performance of the entire cast, with Shaun Parkes as lead actor, Captain Zachary Cross Flane."

It's just a stupid movie about a serial killer being dumped in a load of toxic waste, causing a reaction with him and the snow (since it's in the middle of winter). He then turns into a killer snowman, enough to make you laugh. This movie is really stupid, but it's funny. The killings are hilarious.

Part of his plan is to kidnap Burgade's daughter, which prompts him to strap on his guns and go after him on horseback. Can Burgade who has been retired for sometime still have what it takes to track Provo down?","This came out during the last breath of the Western genre; Unfortunately, it turns out that it is a very small and overall unsatisfactory effort - even if it is done by veterans and on the field! At the beginning, the storyline offers nothing new: James Coburn escapes a chain gang who wants to kill the man (now retired) who brought him there - Charlton Heston. While the latter is trapping him, Coburn outwits Heston by kidnapping his daughter (Barbara Hershey). Of course, the former lawman - accompanied by Hershey's Greenhorn fiancee (Chris Mitchum) - goes hunting for Coburn and his followers, who all collapsed with him in jail. <br /> <br /> Instead of negotiating in his case In the usual sub-Fordian style, McLaglen goes for a Sam Peckinpah approach - which he never feels comfortable with: disgusting characters, violence and sexual tension created by Hershey's presence in Coburn's lustful bunch. By the way, Heston and Coburn had previously performed together in a Sam Peckinpah Western - the troubled MAJOR DUNDEE (1965; I really have to record the restored edition of this on DVD, though I've recently taken the theatrical version in pan-and-scan format TCM UK ). However, the film is too generic to achieve the elegiac mood it clearly aspires to (also indicated by the title): both stars had the most American of all genres - WILL PENNY (1968) for Heston and Coburn with PAT GARRETT & BILLY THE KID (1973)! However, at least Heston retains a modicum of dignity here - his aging character tries to stay ahead of the Cobburn halfblood by anticipating what his next move will be; The latter, however, takes on an unusually brutal role and only comes into its own at the peak (he enjoys his moment of revenge sadistically forcing Heston to witness the rape of Hershey by his colleagues). Apart from the latter, Heston sees in this lengthy sequence deceiving Coburn with a trick borrowed from his own EL CID (1961). The rogue band is then trapped in a bushfire that is outdated by the practiced Heston and the violent death of the two 'protagonists (what was his fashion, Heston's demise takes the form of a gratuitous sacrifice!). <br /> <br /> The side cast includes Michael Parks as the ineffective city sheriff, Jorge Rivero as Coburn's Mexican lieutenant and Larry Wilcox - from the TV series CHIPS! - as the youngest member of Coburn's gang, who has the job of watching over Hershey (while doing his best to keep his drooling buddies out!). Jerry Goldsmith delivers a tasteful but at the same time inconspicuous score."

But with new worlds come ancient evil ... the vampires of space. And not just a handful, but whole tribes. In this movie (which I have seen as ""Bloodsuckers"", but I also believe as ""Vampires Wars"") we see what happens when the imperialist earthlings hit the imperialist vampires. <br /> <br /> I will make this review very short because it does not deserve a good rating. The best I can say for this movie is a good cast of B-lists and upcoming stars. Natassia Malthe was Quintana and was much more attractive here than in ""Bloodrayne 2"". Michael Ironside is Muco and is always a fan favorite (as I say he is Jack Nicholson the poor man). And we even get Carrie-Ann Fleming as ""Damian's Wife"", who will now recognize horror fans as the eponymous Jenifer from Dario Argento's ""Jenifer"". So this movie, bad as it is, is not without a name ... but the same goes for Uwe Boll's work. <br /> <br /> The concept of the military tracking and killing vampires in space is not necessarily a bad idea, but it's easy to go into the ""cheese"" section and this movie is hard to come by. Acting, especially of the vampires, is exaggerated and I found the explanations of their existence simply unconvincing. Worst of all, the vampire tribes have the names ""Voorhess"" and ""Leatherfaces"". I understand that this should be a smart reference for the horror fans, but it was not smart at all. It just sounded stupid and out of place (as opposed to the much more subtle references in James Gunn's ""Slither"", such as the naming of stores for lesser-known horror directors). <br /> <br /> That's all I want to say. If you can endure a lot of cheese (that day I could not and I'm from Wisconsin) and I want to see average actors with bad costumes fight vampires in space (though ""space"" looks a lot like any other forest in the world) This if you can find it.

Sure, the acting is bad, the story is basically a mix of all zombie movies thrown together and the quality is low on some points. What you seemingly misses is that it's still entertaining and really fun. The effects range from, as someone here has said, pasty-faced zombies that like KISS refuse to really good ones with some amazing latex works. But the reason you buy a movie with a title like this is for the blood, and this movie is fantastic in this area. The effects are very good for such a small movie. Someone called it a party movie and it is. 100% funny party movie. I've heard from various websites that this is actually a ""rough cut"" of the movie that was released in general, but the actual ""Director's Cut"" comes on DVD and it's very nice quality. I will buy it and judge for myself. <br /> <br /> Story is basically a nuclear power plant goes bad and makes zombies. The government shuts it down, hides the story and sanctions houses to be built over it. Part of the plant is still underground and these undead come up and attack the area. A few actors are doing a great job, there are some pretty straightforward social comments that are enlightening and true, good music, great lighting, some effective tension and tons of blood and sick blood. A guy is attacked and torn from the bottom, if you know what I mean. Then his guts are pushed out of his mouth. Another guy split in half like in Day Of The Dead and they did a great job. There are a million gore gags and it's almost ALL action. I say, stop being prudish, enjoy life and get more movies like Zombie Bloodbath and Meat Market. Two great undead epics. <br /> <br /> OK - UPDATE !!! I just set the DVD and here's what I thought: <br /> <br /> MUCH better picture quality and for once I could see the actual director cut of the movie, and it's a much better movie. I liked it before, but now I can see what Todd Sheets actually tried with this one. And the commentary also helps by talking about sheets in detail about the film. He knows it's a trashy zombie movie, but he shows respect to everyone involved. Sheets also has a great sense of humor and modest integrity that others can learn in the film industry. The behind-the-scenes Zombie Bloodbath is also pretty funny. I found it almost as entertaining as the movie it was made for. There are some great interviews and behind the scenes footage, mixed with news about the movie from some major venues like CNN, FOX and MTV. All in all, a funny little movie that is VERY rough around the edges but still made me laugh and enjoy the ride! I've seen a lot of DV movies and some video footage, and many are pretty boring, but it really was not. While newer DV movies are technically superior, they just are not that much fun. <br /> <br /> PS - I've heard that they are now recovering on a big budget ???"

It was a good idea, but the annoying acting and the characters always kept me from liking it too much. I did not really feel the need to see its sequel, but when I heard that they were making a third film that would rather be a pre-history of the original. I was intrigued, thinking that maybe they would fix some of the original's problems and give us a memorable cast of characters. Well, I thought wrong. <br /> <br /> ""Cube Zero"" starts well enough by introducing us to the two characters who are responsible for observing and preserving the endless maze of traps that plague people in the cube. The filmmakers manage to give the establishment of the everyday life of the two men a mysterious feeling. This raises several questions, the reason why people are sent there and the true nature of those who lead the entire operation. All of these are completely up to the viewer. Acting was a bit weak, but overall, the first half of the film moved relatively well. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, one of the two ""watchers"" begins to doubt seriously what he is doing. And later decides to help a group of people in the trap. Everything quickly dissolves into boring cheese. <br /> <br /> Sent by the people who run the Cube program, we are introduced to the character ""Jax"". Together with his two subordinates play a major reason why this movie has failed. At the beginning of ""Jax"" he looks and speaks more like a third-rate villain straight out of a James Bond movie complete with the ever-popular ""Glass Eye"" that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the relatively nice tempo of the first half. What's more, it feels more like a comedy rather than a serious movie. With some unbelievably cheesy lines, the scriptwriter might get bored and he did not care. The action itself continues to deteriorate when the former ""observer"" hits the group in the dice. The entire interaction is painful to watch, as well as everything else that follows. <br /> <br /> Once again, it's a waste of time for all those looking for a good horror movie."

When Panzram grew big and strong, he tried to take revenge for the wrongs he had done in South America, Europe, and Africa, and it did not matter which people he raped, robbed, or murdered because we were all worthless. <br /> <br /> This movie throws Skinny James Woods as the rough neck, mean ass, son of a bitch Carl Panzram, who in the movie is a ""drunk,"" over-dramatic, and emotional, and who never mentions the joy, men and to spoil boys.

Overall, it leaves the viewer with the feeling of being involved in a nasty dream appropriate to a thriller of this kind. <br /> <br /> Even though the possible explanation for the heinous crimes is quite ridiculous and is not. With proper land development, the movie can boast of a good cast. Grave Lionel Atwill gives another of his typical accomplishments, this time as a doctor conducting scientific research in an old castle. Beautiful Fay Wray plays his assistant in a role that requires her to do little more than look lovable and alarmed. Dour Melvyn Douglas appears as the stunned police inspector who happens to be Miss Wray's friend. <br /> <br /> Maude Eburne, who could be extremely funny given the right situation, steals most of her scenes as Miss Wray's hypochondriacal aunt. Senior Lionel Belmore plays the frightened mayor of the village.

And I have read it in each of my grades 3 and 5 for the last 18 years of my teaching. Allegedly, a movie had been made in the past, but I could never find it. Well, my students and I were all so excited when we heard that Disney had brought Madeline L'Engles excellent book to the screen. <br /> <br /> When I saw the movie, I had the greatest hopes. As the movie progressed I became increasingly discouraged. They had botched it badly! I have never been so disappointed with a favorite book-to-film adaptation. I understand that movies can not stick to a book, but they do not have to change things for their own sake! Most, if not all, deviations from the book were completely unnecessary! <br /> <br /> At first, I kept my opinion to myself and have just listened to my students discussing the film. Well, it was not just me. Almost everyone felt the same - cheated out of the great story Madeline L'Engle had skilfully created! <br /> <br /> Why, they wondered, did Aunt Beast look like Chewbacca from the Star Wars movie? Why could not Calvin's hair be red? Why did not woman have the right ""witch-like"" outfit that was such a smart game on her name? Basically we all wondered - why did almost every detail have to be changed? <br /> <br /> I've always dreamed of how wonderful a movie would make this book. I'm still waiting for this movie.

The mistakes come quickly and angry, so you have to be on your toes. <br /> <br /> I have not given a ""1"", mainly due to the fact that it is in Liverpool and the actors (the band Rain) give it all (the Lennon character is credible and does a good job) , Also the song ""Cry for a Shadow"" can be heard at one point and that counts for ETWAS. <br /> <br /> So, check it out for fun, but please do not take it so historically correct."

While being attacked by a co-worker who has followed her, a mysterious unseen creature drags him away and kills him. This begins a terrifying ordeal, as Kate and a young homeless couple are stalked through the dark tunnels by something dangerous with payback on its mind.","That's a good little shocker; not perfect from any part of the imagination, but tight, competent and disturbing. An excellent example of a simple idea that has been developed into a compelling 90-minute script. <br /> <br /> The setup requires no frills, no lengthy presentation or wordy backstory; Kate (Franka Pontente), a young German businesswoman living in London, is drifting while waiting for the last subway. She awakens to feel the place as deserted, but quickly realizes that she is not alone. Someone or something is down there with her and her intentions are completely vicious. In fact, she meets several other characters in her quest for survival, including a lustful work colleague, a homeless couple, and a caged sewage worker who all add speed and substance to the plot. Somewhere in the middle of the movie, when the suspense thriller mutates into a Gore feast, it's a bit embarrassing, but nothing so cumbersome to slow down the hustle and bustle. For those of you who have weak dispositions, this will probably be a devastating ride; For those of you who enjoy a bit of well-executed carnal chaos, this should push the right buttons. <br /> <br /> The climax of the film may be less successful than the main part of the movie, but it is interrupted with a beautiful moment of unexpected social commentary that provides a satisfying conclusion. <br /> <br /> Some may feel a bit cheated about a clear explanation of the nature and history of the threat Kate and her allies face, but for me that was not the case. A horror movie author should not have the feeling of crossing and crossing every single point, just as an author of political thrillers would expect. There is enough evidence to give you a very clear idea of ​​what this evil has produced, making a detailed and conclusive solution superfluous. Preserving a certain secret is to be welcomed and reminds us that in this film the journey was always more important than the exact destination. <br /> <br /> My understanding is the budget for this film That was minimal, to say the least, and in this case, our applause for this British horror should be louder, because at no time does one have the impression of corners cut off or effects are not delivered. <br /> <br /> If that sounds like your kind of movie, it probably is.

She risks her neck more than once trying to keep Annie clean and free from trouble. However, Annie's unstable behavior and flare ups keeps everyone on edge.","""Foxes"" is a serious look at the consequences of too rapid growth in the 1980s. And unlike the teenage sex comedies that overshadowed it (Porky's, Fast Times at Ridgemont High), the movie stays well against time. <br /> <br /> His topic of teenage fear is just as relevant today as it was 25 years ago, and Jodie Foster and sk8er boi Scott Baio (do you remember him?) lead a beautiful young cast that's worth watching. <br /> <br /> The film follows four Southern California girls who move through a rootless existence of sex and drugs without parents. Teenagers spend their days in and out of school and their nights at parties, concerts or out in the street. Rarely are they at home because instant gratification is a pill, a party, or a boy. <br /> <br /> But rather than condemning them, the film is sympathetic and accuses absent, indifferent adults forcing teens to grow up by themselves. And the charismatic cast is impossible to like. <br /> <br /> The opening of the movie ?? a long and loving pan - sets the tone for the following. We see the girls sleeping at daybreak amidst the objects that define teenage girls, from twinkies to a picture of a young John Travola, while Donna Summer's ""On the Radio"" stands underneath. <br /> <br /> From there the movie picks up speed as the girls go to school and to life. Annie (Runaway Rocker Cherie Currie) is the wild kid who lives for the next party or pill. Deirdre (Kandice Straw) is the young crazy drama queen. Madge (Marlilyn Straw) is the shy girl in her head. And Foster is the one with the plan. It's her job to keep this crew together long enough to finish high school while at the same time chasing her divorced and desperate husband in line (Sally Kellerman). <br /> <br /> It's an almost impossible job and one that Foster ultimately fails to accomplish. <br /> <br /> Despite his age, ""Foxes"" is a pleasure to behold. Dated hair, clothing and references to the Olympic skater Dorothy Hamill did not hurt the movie. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is simply breathtaking, with breathtaking, filtered footage of the L.A. basin at dawn, dusk and at night. Giorgio Moroder adds a soundtrack from the 80's with greats like Donna Summer and Janis Ian. <br /> <br /> Perhaps the biggest disappointment of the movie is that the young stars around Foster never broke out, like the ""St. Elmo's Fire"" (1985) or ""Empire Records"" (1995). ""Foxes"" shows why they should have. But maybe, like bowling for Soup's song ""1985"", they just hit a wall."

Let's bring Samaire Armstrong back (after seeing her work at the OK, I know she can do better), then you'll find a better script and budget. <br /> <br /> The special effects were so bad and mostly bad computer generated. that it nearly lost me when the wolf was first seen on screen. And Samaire Armstrong's (Alert!) Transformation into a werewolf was made by first reducing her to a bad GCIF character before she even begins to change (Final Fantasy's humans, as well as Pixar's ridiculousness), thinking of the character as naked Barbie Doll). <br /> <br /> The story of was interesting, although the idea of ​​the bloodline in werewolves is nothing new. As well as the balance between the evil, (perhaps) not so evil and the possible end of humanity, the two lines should mate. The subplot of a ""book of the werewolf line,"" which had spelled some of the other characters for a while, was effective, but could have better explained what had happened in the past. <br /> <br /> Bring in a better script and direction and I'll come back."

There is a scene where he gives them everything they want. This is a boring movie with many long sections where little happens. The plot is technically not bad.

It had outstanding acting on the parts of Stone, Douglas and all its subordinates to the smallest role. It had wonderful photography, music and the noirest noir script of all time. It all adds up to a movie that's as good as he'll ever get! <br /> <br /> This sequel is the exact opposite, it can not possibly get worse, bad acting and a lame script, combined with totally awkward direction, that's really bad, boring, annoying. The only thing that keeps you focused is the relatively short wait for the next scene, which is an exactly replicated copy of the original. These copies are so bad that they make you laugh, and I laughed a lot, despite everything, because it was like watching the destruction of a glowing monument. The only things that are good in this terrible mess are the excerpts from the Jerry Goldsmith score from BI1. Michael Caton-Jones and the scriptwriter even have the dialogue ""There is no smoking in this room"" in the interrogation scene and yes, she sends her lawyer (who is now a lawyer) away! <br /> <br /> I'm sorry I saw this horrible movie that should never have been done! It damages the original, it is that bad. The only redeeming value is the realization that cosmetic surgery (and I'm sure Ms. Stone could buy the best surgeon money) can do a good job, but obviously can not restore the perfection of the original. And as far as the human body is concerned, it also applies to filmmaking. There should be a law: never make a sequel to a perfect movie!"

Hero; So I was happy to find it on DVD, so I watched how these topics performed so well. <br /> <br /> Despite the ""conspiracy within the plot"" that included white slavery during the civil war in an African nation, this is not an action movie. The storyline that includes the ""plot-in-a-plot"" is actually a question the movie does not want to solve: is Jake Speed ​​a real person who helps the heroine save her sister from the white slave trader? ; or is he actually a fictional character (meaning that the heroine somehow entered the universe that really only exists in a series of fabric novels)? I suggest that this is not so clearly defined in the film and that Wayne Crawford and Andrew Lane are aware of it. The film thus becomes a presentation of what the audience might expect from a fictional ""adventure story"" universe. This is actually a rich topic whose potential severity is tempered by the lovable and campy sense of humor. <br /> <br /> There are weaknesses in the movie - especially the cinematography that makes the movie look like a television show. And sometimes the pace slows down. <br /> <br /> But I really like these characters, and I enjoy the adventure they live, no matter how silly they are.

It's just as good that it never happened, since Fetchit's characterization of the lazy Negro was amusing in small doses and would be considered very offensive today. Many of the scenes I've just described are good for a few laughs, though the final sequence was so confusing that the results were just too blah for me. In summary, A Tough Winter is a curiosity that should be seen at least once. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry."

As if dubious leads were not bad enough, a story that would make anyone sleep and a very predictable (but illogical) end shoot this movie in the head before it has a chance to run. <br /> <br /> ""Murder By Numbers"" has absolutely nothing to offer, even a senseless nude scene from Bullock would not save it. Well, just a little, but still not enough to save it. Forgettable, predictable and redundant - this is a movie that will not bring the cop genre forward. As Cassie probably says in her next case, there's nothing to see here. Go on, keep moving ..."

He signs a trio of young women, the Dreamettes, gets them a job backing an R&B performer, James ""Thunder"" Early, establishes his own record label and starts wheeling and dealing. When Early flames out, Curtis makes the Dreamettes into headliners as the Dreams, but not before demoting their hefty big-voiced lead singer, Effie White, and putting the softer-voiced looker, Deena Jones, in front. Soon after, he fires Effie, sends her into a life of proud poverty, and takes Deena and the Dreams to the top. How long can Curtis stay there, and will Effie ever get her due?","I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for a long time ... which has to do with all the reviews, nominations and media attention. And I have to say, the first quarter of the movie was good! It really portrayed the black music scene back then. But as the movie went on, my whole family and I were completely bored. The singing came again and again, one after the other. I mean seriously, just a music number and it could even have worked on RENT. <br /> <br /> Also, I have not found any character development on any of the characters; I did not care what happened to them! Even when Eddie Murphy's character died of an overdose of drugs, I knew that I should be sad, but I just could not feel any emotions for that character. The characters got a weak background about singing in their childhood and whatever, but there the personalities were not revealed enough to pull me in. <br /> <br /> After all, the conflict was simply not significant enough to interest viewers as to the lack of character development. This movie reminded me of a copycat movie based on Ray, Chicago and Rent (Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion). Overall, I think this film would be best suited to someone who is not really into an overall story, but still enjoys two hours of entertaining and entertaining vocal engagements."

Bank sub-manager Jimmy McCoy finds her a job in the bank only to be cast aside as she hooks up with the bank's president. When he complains of not seeing her she says: ""I'm working so hard I have to go to bed early every night.""","This is one of the boldest and most important of the so-called ""pre-code"" films shot in Hollywood in the 1930s. In contrast to some pre-code films that occasionally dealt with issues that would never have been allowed after 1934/5, this film plunged from start to finish into a very dirty but entertaining storyline. The conventional morality of the late 30s and 40s was definitely NOT obvious in this film, since the movie is essentially about a sneaky woman who sleeps her way to the top - and does not apologize. These ""big boys"" both enjoyed sex and used it on every man who could help her get rich, something that would never have been seen in movies that were made only two or three years later. <br /> <br /> The movie begins with Barbara Stanwyck working in her dad's whiskey bar. She is not only her boss but also her pimp and encourages her to sleep with a local government official so that he can run away from the illegal bar with impunity. Although not clear, it seems that Daddy has ""borrowed"" his daughter's body for a long time. <br /> <br /> After being almost raped and attacking this man by tearing a bottle of beer With his skull, Barbara has had enough and goes to the big city. It does not hurt that she still blew up her father and killed her, but her sense of self-expulsion and showing nothing seemed to be the impulse to move. <br /> <br /> Despite Depression, Barbara uses sex to get a job at a huge mega-bank. She starts a rather low job as a store manager, but sleeps from one job to the next in a matter of just a few weeks - until she sleeps with the head of the bank and his future son-in-law !!! It all ends in tragedy, but Babs does not seem too shaken by the deaths of these two men. In fact, she can later immerse herself in the life of the NEW CEO and is once again at the top (perhaps in more ways than one). <br /> <br /> Now it's time for a wonderful movie, because it was so rude and unrepeatable. Barbara played a 100% sociopath - a woman without morals and without conscience - just a desire to squeeze as much out of life as she could, no matter who hurt her. But the brave authors and producers ""dumped"" and thought it important to risk a redemptive end. Considering that this woman was so evil and deceitful, her change of heart was a big disappointment in the end and seriously affected the movie. In many ways, this reminded me of the end of JEZEBEL - how again a bad person ""sees the light"" and changes at the not very convincing conclusion. <br /> <br /> My advice is to try to watch RED-HEADED WOMAN and DOWNSTAIRS. RED-HEADED WOMAN resembles BABY FACE, but in the end has no magical transformation - the main actress is really a skunk! In DOWNSTAIRS, a movie very similar to RED-HEADED WOMAN, the roles are reversed and a man (John Gilbert) plays a similar dogged character. Both are classics and a bit better than this movie. <br /> <br /> This movie is an amazing curiosity of a short time of often ultra-greasy Hollywood movies and in this light it is very worth seeing for Cinephiles. Even fans of The Duke take note - John Wayne plays a very minor role in the film and it is very unusual for a very young Wayne to play such a conventional role."

""PP"" reminds me of one of the many protracted, promising, but predictable David Kelly Flicks (Picket Fences, Ally McBeal and now Boston Legal). The crazy cases that they get are so strange that they hardly cause sympathy or sadness. And that's what makes good medical dramas - dramatic situations you're afraid of ""That could be me"" mood. They are not funny either. <br /> <br /> The actors are pretty good, but the storylines are dead and can not be brought back to life. I'm a therapist and let me tell you - Amy Brennan plays the incredibly incompetent, unethical, untrained therapist. Whoever writes their stuff went through the ethics and broadcast / countertransference courses at Stanford. Someone should give them an ethics code for reading (the episode with the woman bleeding in the nose and the therapist's involvement). No therapists are so bad. <br /> <br /> Women who crave men who have moved on - have died, we all have ""Sex and the City"". Addison, in her adolescent aggression to the type she likes - very age-related, looks so unnatural to a woman over 40, and this otherwise talented actress does not believe it herself and does not deliver it very well. The only successful / tasty developments are that Addison struggles with her decision to move to LA and the ""Voodoo Dr"" and his mastering of widowhood. <br /> <br /> This concept could work with a whole new writing team."

That was when she was sixteen. Of course, she would not be as smart as the one in the book, considering she's only in the 10th grade. Otherwise, I thought the movie would be very cute. It was clean and adequate for everyone. It was funny sometimes. I thought Emma Roberts did a great job. She was articulate, full of character and sweet. I liked the embarrassment Nancy and Ned had because they were obviously not old enough to be in a serious relationship, as they had in the books. It was a cute PG movie that I enjoyed a lot because, unlike most people my age, I enjoy films without sex, drugs or obscenity."

But life in New York is hard and tragedy tarnishes their dream of a better life in the new world.,"""The Italian"" is one of the big or almost big movies of 1915 that are available today. The year was a turning point for the feature film, especially in America: Lois Weber's ""hypocrite"", Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Cheat"" and, of course, D.W. Griffith's ""The Birth of a Nation"" sets new standards for the arts. This year, Russian filmmaker Yevgeni Bauer shot two of his best pictures, ""After Death"" and ""Daydreams"". The French series ""Les Vampires"" also has their admirers today, although I disagree with them. The creation of the full-length film was led by Europe, mainly by Denmark, France and Italy, but the dominance of this market and, to a degree, art shifted in 1915 across the Atlantic. <br /> <br /> The most important artistic achievement of ""The Italian"" is its stunning and often innovative cinematography. There are some picturesque sunsets, moving framing, including a short overhead shot of the Italian race to buy a wedding ring, and another shot of him holding on a moving car, and in general there are clever uses of different camera angles and Expert lighting throughout A particularly stunning shot is a close-up of the Italian who gets angry as he slowly approaches the camera to an extreme close-up, reminiscent of DW Griffith's ""Musketeers of the Pig Alley"" (1912). He is so angry that his surroundings even begin to shake his anger. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately the cameraman seems to be unknown. The director, although originally without credit in the film, is now known to Reginald Barker. About five of his other films made for Ince are also available today, but tend to be unremarkable. ""Civilization"" (1916), which he worked on, was a big production but a deeply flawed film. Incidentally, I suppose one or more of the cameramen who worked on Civilization also took photographs of The Italian. <br /> <br /> In addition, all production is very advanced at this time. Venice and New York are well done, though the film was filmed in Los Angeles (for the romanticized Venice) and San Francisco (for the ethnic slums of New York). There are extensive flashbacks, though maybe one or two too many. I particularly like the clever division of the narrative, as it is played in a book by a character played by the same actor, George Beban, who also plays the main role in the inner main narrative. Reading the story is further briefly framed by opening at the beginning and closing at the end of the curtain blinds, à la theater, reflecting in the inner story during the Revenge climax in the nursery, with the opening and closing of window curtains. Parallel editing, in-camera dissoles and irises are professionally handled. In addition, Beban and Clara Williams play a good role as his wife. <br /> <br /> On the other hand, ""The Italian"" has some disadvantages. The early moments of the film's comedy coincide rather discordantly with the last bits of hard and heavy melodrama, though the environmental changes from romanticized Italy to naturalistic New York work well, largely because it is aided by lighting and photography. The harsh dissolution of the American dream in this film, reinforced by the sharp photographs, must have been urgent for the immigrant classes, who were then a disproportionately large population of the film audience. The Corrigan character should have anticipated more; His brief introduction, which advocates for another politician, seems inadequate for his later centrality to the Italian's revenge. In addition, the filmmakers were either medically naïve or careless in not explaining the child's lack of breastfeeding and unwarranted belief in the healing powers of rest for the other child. Apart from the flaws in the plot, ""The Italian"" is exceptionally well done."

In Offside, Panahi's serio-oomic homage to Iranian women who stand up for their rights, I do not think he's that successful. Of course, not what he says is not important (and it's a pity that, like almost every other Panahi film, the Iranians can not see it). But after a while, the movie feels a bit flat and even feels like 90 minutes. Not to say that I did not like it. The actors are all fantastic and the celebration at the end of the film is contagious.

The movie show us how Hitler turned from a poor soldier into the leader of the Nazis, and how he survived the attempts to kill him. It describes his relationship with his mistress Eva Braun, and his decisions and enemies inside Germany and inside the Nazi party.","Well, first I would like to add that I myself am a historian. In a movie based on historical events, I search for historical facts. However, this is not the case here. Sure, the movie is entertaining and anything but the fact that it's not based on true facts is more than annoying. Hitler was not anti-Semitic in his youth, he even worked for Jews before the First World War. However, it was during the First World War and after that he formulated his views on the Jews. His education in this film is also inaccurate, Hitler as a child was not a disturbed little brat. He had a more or less normal education. Nothing is mentioned about his lost brothers and other important pieces that contribute to the puzzle that is Hitler. <br /> <br /> Robert Carlyle is a great actor, but he does not really fit into the role of Hitler. Hitler was not as impossible and unstable as he is portrayed here. In his younger years he was a charismatic person who ""manipulated"" people through his charms. His unstable behavior and outbursts of anger began in the turning point of the war. <br /> <br /> I would like to see a film about Hitler's life, based on true historical facts and not on allegations. I really hate it, for example, when people blame Hitler and others for blaming and tell inaccurate stories, just to paint a picture of them as pure evil. It is much better to tell the story EXACTLY so that everyone can learn what it was like! Those behind this film should do some research before the creation. Because it seems like they do not even know what really happened. Hitler was not even shot dead during the revolutionary march in Munch, his shoulder was torn out of his socket. <br /> <br /> There is more to see a good documentary than to see it."
1,tt0338075,0,"There are times when it's right and proper to simply bury the dead. This is not one of those times... Gram Parsons was one of the most influential musicians of his time; a bitter, brilliant, genius who knew Elvis, tripped with the Stones and fatally overdosed on morphine and tequila in 1973. And from his dying came a story. A story from deep within folklore; a story of friendship, honour and adventure; a story so extraordinary that if it didn't really happen, no one would believe it. Two men, a hearse, a dead rock star, five gallons of petrol, and a promise. And the most extraordinary chase of modern times.","This movie was a real disappointment to me. I was a fan of Gram Parsons for a long time, and when I found out they were making a movie about him, I was very excited. I got the movie on VHS when it came out, and was disgusted with what I saw. The movie was not about his life but about the consequences of his death. I thought it was a descent of Gram's life and music, but they had to make a film about his death. I'm fed up with hearing about his death in books and movies, I wanted a movie about his life, not his notorious death. I was very disappointed. I wish people would look at his life, more than his death. The only good thing about this movie was its soundtrack. This movie is a disappointment for any Gram Parsons fan."

In Broken Wing, Belle urges the Beast to free a tiny songbird as an act of kindness. Enriched with gentle lessons and two original songs that seamlessly fold one tale into the next.","Disney has now made straight to video sequels a good part of their many animated features. Two of them were made for their classic ""Beauty and the Beast"" from 1991. Well, these are not real sequels, since they are both located between the events of the first movie. The first of these two Direct Video Movies was ""The Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas,"" which some fans of their theater predecessor did not seem to enjoy, but I think that's usually going to happen with sequels. However, this second, ""Belle's Magical World"", is definitely inferior. <br /> <br /> The film shows three short stories, all taking place while Belle is in the castle, and the place is mesmerized by the sorceress. The first is ""The Perfect Word,"" where a misunderstanding at the table between Belle and the Beast causes trouble and none of the first apologizes. The next story is ""Fifi's Folly,"" which marks the fifth birthday of Fifi and Lumiere, and Lumiere is unprepared, so Belle helps him. However, Fifi sees Lumiere practicing Belle with Belle and thinks that she is indeed in love. The film ends with ""The Broken Wing"". In this story, Belle looks after a bird with a broken wing, but a bird in the castle is likely to cause trouble when the animal finds out how he hates birds! <br /> <br /> The plot I gave is for the original VHS version of Disney's third movie, Beauty and the Beast. Apparently the DVD version adds another story called ""Mrs. Potts's Party"", but I only saw the original version. However, as I very much doubt that a story would stand out as a classic over the rest, I see no point in seeing the special edition. Anyway, the first thing I'll say about ""Belle's Magical World"" is that the animation is very two-dimensional compared to what we are used to from Disney, which obviously would disappoint many people. I did not like ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" so much, but you certainly can not say the same thing about its animation. I am sure that the stories in ""Belles magical world"" entertain many children (mostly younger, I think), and every story has a moral, so they can teach them valuable lessons. But for adults, the movie really does not have much. Personally, I was in no mood for it, finding that the constant conflict between Belle and the Beast became tiring, and the stories did not impress me at all (they are not very well written). In ""The Perfect Word,"" Belle tells the beast, ""You're being rude ... and stupid!"" It's a bit cheesy, and I think there are a few other cheesy moments in these stories. <br /> <br /> When this video came out, I was about eleven or twelve years old. I do not know what I thought about it at the time, since I had lost interest in Disney until then, and it would be years before I regained that interest. Even when this film was first released, I think I've gone a bit beyond the age group it was focused on. I saw ""Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas"" just a few months ago, but unlike this movie, I've never heard of it until recently, I think, after watching the first installment of Disney's 1991 hit. Well, as much as I like the theatrical original, I would not have missed much if I had never noticed the existence of this film. For small children, I am sure that ""Belle's Magical World"" can be very entertaining and probably somewhat instructive with its moral, but I do not recommend it for adult Disney fans."

The chemistry between the young Ann and Buddy is great. They have fun and dance. Then ... shall you believe that she no longer likes him as a friend and that his yearning only annoys her. And I thought the whole thing, ""he could be gay,"" was out of the blue and served no purpose. <br /> <br /> Then we have Harris. The character looks wooden and scary. Had that been another genre, you would have known Harris was a serial killer right from the start. It's an incredible stretch to think that all these girls loved him so much (but they make the other guys look pretty lame to help him out). <br /> <br /> And the greatest problem of all. Why do not Ann and Harris get together? They fall for each other. You have this great night of sex in an old dirty gardening shack, come home to experience Buddy's tragic end and then ... <br /> <br /> Nothing. <br /> <br /> They meet a few years later, and all have been fogged and I could not help but wonder why. WHY? The movie does not let you know why they were forced to marry other people, so I had a hard time pitying them. <br /> <br /> The part of the story in the present is pretty boring. The stereotype good daughter and the stereotype bad daughter. Nina changes the course of the movie, but I'm not sure why. I'm not sure what convinced her to change her life. There is a ""touching"" scene where the daughters meet, who agree with old Ann, who dreams that she is chasing a butterfly. It is really lame and embarrassing. <br /> <br /> ""There are no mistakes,"" Ann advises us. The statement does not match the story. And it does not sound true after watching the movie and I wish they had not wasted the talent of such good actors."

He meets with an amount of local hostility, while his life is at risk from those on the fascist side. Support comes from an unlikely if attractive quarter.","A film that dramatizes an understandable aversion to the inevitable arrival of World War II when a Spanish Republican sent by his soon overthrown government (Charles Boyer) interferes in England to seek support for his cause Affecting wealthy mine owners, not to sell the coal to the fascists in Spain. Annoying the locals, he is convincingly beaten in one scene, and faces a raging band of miners later in the film who see him as another threat to their shaky livelihood. Despite its socioeconomic hierarchy, xenophobia and world politics, this film skilfully deals with a dark and intriguing intrigue with unfaithful compatriots played by Katina Paxinou and Peter Lorre.

This is one thing that is wrong with our world right now, so many people in bad relationships, selfish and do not know what it really means to truly love another. It is self-sacrificing and not something that should be merritt. This does not give you a very good feeling of watching what should be in private consultation.

There is not any quality of redemption about this film. The first 10 minutes are quite difficult - they actually lead you to believe that this movie will be shocking and will have you on the edge of your seat. Instead, spend 83 minutes beating yourself while seeing stolen and bad scenes without organization. The lake was ridiculous, looked like an aquarium and had the same plant in different parts of the lake bed. Characters show their advanced teleportation abilities, such as Alex Thomas, who falls drunk into the lake and then lands in an impossible position on his boat. Angie Harmon performed a miserable performance as Kate, aggravated by the space-time-continuum-rift dialogue written last minute by a fifth grader. An example of this would be when she said, ""Flashlight!"" in such a silly way that it shows the threshold of how much a human body can shrink before it locks in the middle. After all, editing this movie was by far the most bizarre and dreadful I've ever seen. It was as if the cameramen had been a bunch of chimpanzees that scientists had given camcorders. An example would be if we suddenly get a close-up of the headlight on Alex's car. I bet there was little or no time to edit this movie. The end was absolutely pathetic. Obviously, the authors were trying to create a sort of mysterious storylines that would make the viewer, ""Oh yeah!"" Instead, we look at a stupid spider that somehow fits in with the plot. Unfortunately, there is not a million-dollar perspective that could save this film from being a blackening crap. <br /> <br /> I give this 0.5 out of 10, with the .5 coming from the fact that this movie was shot on film instead of becoming a storybook."

This movie has shown me that you do not have to have such a thing. <br /> <br /> I could just put it that way. But IMDb wants me to have more lines. It was kind of pretty. not necessarily in the least.

10,tt0908196,1,The murder of a cop in 1968 is reopened when a dying jailbird makes a deal with the police in order to get released earlier and tells them that he found drugs in the victim's car.,"Over the years, I've seen a few cold-case episodes, starting with Season 1 episodes in 2003-2004. And though most were good, this particular episode was not only the best of the best, but also has few rivals in the Emmy categories. Although some do not agree with the content of the story (ie, the relationship between man and man), I doubt anyone could see that without being deeply moved in their minds. <br /> <br /> The story is essentially about a case reopened based on the testimony of a dying drug trafficker. The two key players in the 1960s are two police officers named Sean Coop (aka the cold Fallopfer bearing his surname Coop) and his partner Jimmy Bruno. <br /> <br /> In the story, Coop Single, Vietnam veterinarian, is having a deeply troubled past. Jimmy, however, is married, with children no less. Both are partners in the police and not only form a friendship, but also a secret love affair, both of which must hide from a profound and obviously homophobic culture. <br /> <br /> The flashback scenes of her life are mostly in black and white, with occasional splashes of color. Examples include the red police car, the yellow curtains on the window in Jimmy's bedroom, where Jimmy's wife watched Coop and Jimmy drinking in an alcoholic state arguing and kissing. I found it interesting that only selected items were colored in the flashback scenes, everything else in black and white. I still have not figured out the color scheme and the reasons for it. <br /> <br /> The clearly homophobic tension between colleagues and the two main players only increases the intensity of the episode. An important emotional scene was when Coop was confronted with his father after the christening of Jimmy's baby. In this scene, Coop's father, Sarge, who was a respected military officer, confronts Coop over the rumors about Coop's relationship with Jimmy. One can be sorry for Coop, at the time when Coop's father's shame and shame on Coop was heaped on her - ""You will not embarrass our family ... and you're not my son."" - Clear reference to the hostile views of same-sex relations of this epoch. <br /> <br /> Additional tension can also be seen in the police gown, in the Coop and another officer after Coop and Jimmy with the inscription ""Batman and Robin Homos"". <br /> <br /> As for the relationship between Coop and Jimmy, it is obvious that Coop wanted more of Jimmy in his life. Once you can see the tension in Jimmy's face when he has to choose between his devotion to his wife and children, his church and yet his undying devotion to Coop. <br /> <br /> In the end, Jimmy leaves Coop, aware that he can not have Coop and his family at the same time. Sadly, Coop is being killed, perhaps because of his relationship with Jimmy, but Coop may also have been killed for his knowledge of drug money and police corruption, which was higher in the troop. <br /> <br /> The most moving scene Throughout the episode, Coop, as he died from gunshot wounds in his patrol car, softly said his last words about his police radio to his partner: ""Jimmy ... we were the lucky ones not that. ""<br /> <br /> The soundtrack selection was outstanding throughout the episode. I enjoyed the closing scene with actor Chad Everett playing the still grieving Jimmy, who is now much older and clearly misses his former partner Coop. <br /> <br /> I recommend this episode and consider it the best. It's without a doubt the best written, well played and well done of all the Cold Case episodes I've ever seen."

It's a good movie, but it's not going to be that classic movie like The Sound Of Music, West Side Story, the Wizard of Oz, etc. Michael Jackson as an actor was good and so were the other performers. There were disturbing scenes like the little girl Katie beaten by gangster Frankie Video, played by Joe Pesci. The scene that scared me when I was younger was when Michael turned into a robot.

Here the effect is much more realistic and really invades the minds of the three protagonists as they sneak through a youth traversed by pitfalls. The three principals, all unknown to me, make very confident appearances, perhaps so natural that it becomes difficult for them to repeat that quality of acting in other films, so I would not be too surprised if they did not hear again become.

Every movement and nuance of their performance makes any other Bollywood heroine fall back into importance. Her masterful interpretation of Kathak, coupled with her grace, tragic vulnerability and poetic delivery of Urdhu, is like nothing that has ever been seen on the Bollywood canvas. <br /> <br /> Pakeezah is perhaps the most stylized interpretation of the human condition; The photography, the magnificent cinematography and staging are so charged with symbolism and meaning that the viewer is breathless. <br /> <br /> Naushad's music is second to none, his knowledge of Gharana's courtesan music is unbelievable, and the way he punctuates the narrative with dark atmospheric motifs and overwhelming romantic melodies is indeed remarkable. <br /> <br /> My only advice to anyone seriously enjoying the spectacle of total cinema should be to watch this epic mediation life and art."

Daniel Auteil, from the distasteful ""The Closet"" of 2001, plays down his role and is afraid of playing too much (rightly, the role could have been ruined if the actor were too dramatic). However, I felt that the part was a bit more realistic and focused more on the character itself than on the character's growth. <br /> <br /> Do not go into this movie and expect the dark humor and the unexpected twists You have ""Toto the hero"" because you will be disappointed.

The good thing about the movie is that in some places you think for a while about the spiritual theme, evolution, sensuality and your role in the world. <br /> <br /> However, the immersion of the film is easy to break and there is very little relationship between the viewer and the characters. It is very clear that the book loses a lot in this movie version. The events that should show sincronicity are almost unrecognizable.

The first 2 seem to have gotten more scenes than their characters to save the movie, and because they paid more, but that does not work. Most scenes are not really necessary and do not help the story at all. <br /> <br /> Jürgen does well in his scenes and sells himself as a bad guy (as always), but the script does not help him with it all. The scene in which he tries to convince John (Matthew Settle) to join him is just a bad script. The execution of the scene, when he dies in an explosion, is performed absurdly bad. The flashbacks during the movie can not even be commented on. <br /> <br /> Overall, this movie is a big time bale, read the book!

The young woman is actually the daughter of the leader he ousted.","I suppose this movie is relevant today because it was an early Sofia Loren movie. She was 19 years old when the movie was shot in 1953. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie because I wanted to see some of Sofia Loren's early work. I was surprised when she came to the camera after her skin was browned in brown makeup to resemble an Ethiopian princess. Sure, today this would be considered a bow and avoided in filmmaking. It actually became annoying to see Ms. Loren in skin color throughout the movie. <br /> <br /> Yes, this movie would have been done better if the real opera singers made this movie. Then the vocals and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been obvious. I discount the comments of others, if the real opera singers are older and heavier. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as Ms. Loren was at the age of 19 and still is today, the movie would have been shot better than even though it was played on stage. After all, we do not see any beautiful young people singing on stage with ""old opera singers"" behind the scenes behind the curtain! Do not be shy about the success of using heavy opera singers. All you need to do is refer to the most artistically produced commercial for the J. G. Wentworth Company, where the opera singers on stage so professionally sing the praise of the company's product. This is one of the best and most entertaining TV commercials ever produced. <br /> <br /> The quality of film printing also makes this production a little worse. The color ink has faded a lot and that can not be helped. <br /> <br /> To improve this movie on DVD, the production company should add English subtitles so that we, who do not speak Italian, can know what the text is saying. It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator 30 seconds introduction to the scenes. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie because of the story of Aida or the fact that this is an opera.

4,tt0478197,0,"Legendary poet, singer/songwriter and alleged ladies man Leonard Cohen is interviewed in his L.A. home about his extraordinary life and times, interspersed with old footage from his private photo collection and lavish praise plus elaborately performed Cohen cover songs from a motley crew of colleague musicians, amongst whom Kate & Anna McGarrigle, Rufus & Martha Wainwright, Nick Cave, Jarvis Cocker and U2's Bono and The Edge. By way of dessert the latter two and their band mates even get to back up the man for a special performance of his own.","This movie should have been only 10 minutes. I mean, in this thing there is really only 10 minutes worth of content (I even hesitate to call it a movie). The opening credits of the film was promising. Since the film starts with brief comments from the man himself, you really rub your hands and stay tuned for more shots of Cohen's life. Well, Nick Cave does a decent job for one of Cohen's famous songs. The length of Cave's Performance makes you even more eager to see more of Cohen whose wit and well-spoken words have tickled you already. But, as it turns out, Cave's performance is just the beginning of lengthy, boring performances by literally a group of no-one who does not even have the slightest attraction to keep you in place. I mean, what does the filmmaker really think? Five minutes of close-ups of would-be singers in a fake concert in Australia !!! What does the filmmaker think to offend the public by adding ""false applause"" to these endless, mean performances? The film is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you have seen. There is not a single footage of Cohen's past. Apart from some photos of his early days as a singer / poet there is absolutely nothing! If you add up all the minutes that Cohen speaks, you may not even reach 10 minutes. But these 10 minutes are treacherously presented between the catastrophic camera work that is being held by some of the most unattractive people who scream Cohen's lyrics. If you ever decided to waste your money on this movie, DO NOT! Just throw it in the trash and save yourself at least time."

Mulder believes the heart attacks were brought on by massive amounts of pheromones though Scully is somewhat skeptical. The geographic distribution of the murders leads them to Massachusetts and a religious cult known as the Kindred. The sect allows them into the group provided they surrender their weapons. They are also upset to learn that one of them may be committing murders in the outside world. They have a secret however, one that will astound the open-minded Mulder.","Gender Bender does something for the X-Files. This episode has an interesting premise, a good story, but an end that's missing. Gender Bender is also the X-Files debut for actor Nicholas Lea, better known as Alex Krycek. In this episode he plays Michael, a man who was attacked by one of ""The Kindred"". You have to see this episode just to see Nic Lea's less spectacular debut. An interesting thing about the ""power of seduction"" of Kindred. When Marty does it to his victims, they turn to him. But when Andrew seduces Scully, she's just disoriented and dizzy and is not attracted to Andrew. Maybe it's because Marty has more experience than Andrew. This episode reminds me why it was sometimes unfortunate to film in British Columbia. Throughout the episode, it's so wet, muddy and muddy that it would not have been much fun. Despite the disappointing ending, Gender Bender is still a decent episode."
10,tt0115669,1,"Wang Bianlian is an aging street performer known as the King of Mask for his mastery of Sichuan Change Art in a true story. His wife left him with and infant son over 30 years ago. The son died from illness at age 10. This left Wang a melancholy loner aching for a male descendent to learn his rare and dying art. A famous master performer of the Sichuan Opera offers to bring him into his act, thus giving Wang fame and possible fortune, but Wang opts for staying the simple street performer. Then, one night after a performance he is sold a young boy by a slave trader posing as the boy's parent. ""Grandpa"" finds new joy in life as he plans to teach ""Doggie"" (an affectionate term often used for young children in China) his art. All is well until Doggie is found out to really be a girl.","King of Masks is a shockingly beautiful and deeply moving film. The film is based on a true story and has won 16 awards from around the world. The focus is on Wang Bianlian, a street artist in 1930s China who gets older but has no successor to pass on his face-changing art. He has a unique talent for quickly switching masks in performance and no one knows how he does it. He longs to have a grandson because his art is a family heirloom that can only be passed on to a male heir. We then go out on the street and see people selling their children because they can not afford to take care of them: some even beg for their daughters to be taken for nothing, because daughters in this society are not worth much. Wang Bianlian's story continues from there. <br /> <br /> The movie was so amazingly good, the acting was amazing, and the issues were so weighty and well addressed. There is inequality between the sexes and the depressing fact that no one wants a little girl in this time and place. Interestingly, the famous opera actor who always plays a woman and is known as the Living Bodhisattva is a man who dresses as a woman, and while he is famous and respected, he sees himself as a lowly, half-woman. As we move further into the movie, the issues of the human slave trade and its demand and thus the lack of a possible solution to it, face the brutality and corruption of the military and police and the helplessness and lack of power that each individual can face due to unfortunate events or even good intentions. <br /> <br /> This is definitely one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, and Xu Zhu, the actor who plays Wang Bianlian, presents another beautiful performance."

Commander Clint Reed, a doctor with the U.S. Public Health Service, diagnoses a highly contagious disease, pneumonic plague. He tries to convince local officials to find everyone who may have been in contact with the dead man. The Mayor supports his efforts but many, including the police, are doubtful. Reed wants to avoid publicity so as not to panic the public. They have little information to go on - they don't know the dead man's identity - and Reed estimates they have 48 hours before disease begins to spread. With police Capt. Tom Warren going through the motions, Reed sets out to find the killers.","Kazan's early film Noir won an Oscar. Some of the reviews here are very detailed and detailed on the film and its symbolism and rate it very high. I can almost see where they come from. But I prefer to make a long-forgotten film, which was apparently filmed without budget and documentary, a little weaker. In the streets of New Orleans, the lung plague is going on, and it is the job of a military doctor (Widmark) and a city detective (Douglas) to arrest the main transporter (Palance). The film is moody, recorded in strong black and white and uses places very well. Widmark is wonderful as always. Forget the symbolism (crime equals illness and disease equals crime) and just enjoy the hunt. It is not always easy to see a movie like this, now that we are in this new century, because it is of a particular style that was very short-lived (after the Second World War to the early fifties) and probably not for laymen will be interesting movie observers. For those who will see this for the first time, commit to the big chase in the end. It's different, and honestly, I do not know how they filmed it. I can say that it probably took just as long to film the finale as the first 90 percent of the movie."

Arthur proposes but then meets a girl with no money who he could easily fall in love with.","I have loved this movie since its 1981 debut! I've lost track of how many times I've seen it! It always makes me laugh or cheer when I feel depressed. The three leads are awesome and the script is priceless, and how do you not get nostalgic when listening to the theme song? I think, I pull this movie without realizing it. I know the whole script, so if anyone sees it for the first time, I have to hold back and say something about how funny the next line is. I can not even narrow it down, though, Sir John's character is probably the most memorable. The famous ""I'll alert the media"", when Arthur announces his intention to take a bath, is still priceless, but the list is truly endless. The scene with Arthur, who will soon be the father's fiancé's house, is a hoot, especially his interactions with the moose. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie!"

I'm always happy that new shows are going well considering that many shows go out before you can really get a feel for them.

I'm just looking at repetitions, but I'm looking forward to the next season. All characters in the show give the whole story something. It's nice to see an old face from other shows I've enjoyed in the past, like Jennie Garth from ""90210"", Leslie Grossman from ""Popular"" and Wesley Jonathan from ""City Guys"". The New Character are also very talented, Nick Zano has the charm that you love him, even if he did something wrong (Bynes). <br /> <br /> Overall, this show has the right ingredients to succeed.

There is only something in the, well, stupidity of this strip that makes me want to see it whenever it runs.

With his friends and the local nerd, Homer sets to do just that by trial and a lot of error. Unfortunately, most of the town and especially Homer's father thinks that they are wasting their time. Only one teacher in the high school understands their efforts and lets them know that they could become contenders in the national science fair with college scholarships being the prize. Now the gang must learn to perfect their craft and overcome the many problems facing them as they shoot for the stars.","This is a gem, a real piece of Americana for all that this includes. If you yourself are programmed to resist ""life-affirming"" stories, just stay away and leave it to the rest of us who still believe. And what makes the icing on the cake really delicious is the fact that it's based on a true tale of rags-to-millionaire, without having to apologize for the details that have been changed to make a compact story. Chris Cooper is one of the greatest live actors, and the complex, self-contradictory goodness of the core father he portrayed could only be made successful by someone with his skills and insights. The simple-minded comments that refuse to accept a father trying to break the law while sensing that he may not be on the line expose the limitation of the commentator, not the scribe or the acting.

The sons of a minister, the boys eventually part company when Norman moves east to attend college, leaving his rebellious brother to find trouble back home. When Norman finally returns, the siblings resume their fishing outings, and assess both where they've been and where they're going.","One of the things about the movie that warmed my heart strings was that dry fly fishing was a major part of the scene. I occasionally did my dry fly fishing, tied my own flies, and, with my brother and dad, spent a day on one or the other river, getting the elusive brook trout to get up and take the fly offered to them. <br /> <br /> When we had such opportunities, the differences between us disappeared, and every pressure of the world melted away to be replaced by fame, to be absorbed in the activity and life of the place, in we were. <br /> <br /> This was one of the amazing things I was told in the movie when the pastor and his two sons, Norman and Pauly, performed the ritual. Because when fly fishing there is something ritual, because there are so many games ritual. You can not just throw your fishing line and hope for the best. You'll need to adjust to where you are, scan in the surface of the water, considering how it's flowing and where the best point might be to place your fly and, depending on your skill, you could even your fly to land there long enough for a fish to notice and strike. The ""art of fly fishing"" has been so well steered and represented that they themselves can be classified as artists. <br /> <br /> The title of the film could not be chosen more aptly, because the river actually went through the life of father and two sons. However, this film is spreading wider than the family and community in Montana, on the Blackfoot River, where the movie is being played. It has the ability to involve you, inspire you, captivate you as the family, community and time story unfolds. The narrated story is not just a family story, but a story of life. What can be classified as the ""flow of life"""

Tarzan wrestles every wild animal imaginable to protect Jane but when he disallows the expedition from plundering ivory from the elephant burial grounds, it is he who takes a bullet from Arlington's gun. Jane eventually believes that Tarzan is dead but he is nursed back to health by the apes. As Jane and the returning expedition are attacked by violent natives, we wonder if Tarzan can rescue them yet again.","I recommend watching this movie with your partner if you are planning a romantic evening with him. The chemistry between Johnny Weissmuller and Maureen O'Sullivan as Tarzan and Jane is so oppressive that it could fog your screen. <br /> <br /> After the original film we start to see how Tarzan and Jane adapted to the jungle and each other. Jane's terse jungle attire and Tarzan's protest, as Jane hides her visitors, illuminate that they are not only romantic but also sexually in love. <br /> <br /> The imagination can be the constant touching and love conversation between Tarzan & Jane to illustrate how much Jane Tarzan teaches love emotionally, romantically and sexually. And Jane's student is not only hugging, but thrives on his unprecedented sexuality. <br /> <br /> The skin show in this movie is not in the charts. In addition to Jane's two-piece sexy waist, leg and hip baring costume, she also has an underwater nude swim with Tarzan. (Although it's not O'Sullivan, but the Olympic swimmer Josephine McKim, who doubles for them in this scene) Weissmuller also shows a huge body and perfect chest muscles in his barely present loincloth. The ladies will be happy when Weissmüller emerges from the water after his long fight with the giant crocodile and lets out his cry - with his water-soaked loincloth he literally falls off his hips. <br /> <br /> It is a shame that the over-protection censors have toned down the adult nature of Tarzan films after this entry. Although the Weissmuller Tarzan films would still flourish in the coming years, they would barely approach the sex appeal of this film."
8,tt0161634,1,"A group of guys capture a young girl with the intent of hurting her. They torture her in many ways, from beating her to putting a sharp piece of needle-like metal through her eye which pierces across her retina.","Many people like this series unfairly, but some of Guinea Pig's videos are pretty entertaining. Devil's experiment, in particular, has some truly fantastic effects - not just the infamous eyeball scene, but also a very realistic skin on the foot and a hand slamming with a sledgehammer are very realistic - especially for the vintage and low budget of the videos. <br /> <br /> Let me start now for those who do not know: This film is an ""extreme"" torture / counterfeiting snuff movie that appeared in Japan in the mid-1980s. The story is simple: a young girl is being held by a few men and forced to brutally torture herself to see where her break point lies. This brings with it brutal violence - all realistic effects including those mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as a painful-looking application of hot oil to the trapped girl's arm and the insertion of maggots into the subsequent flaky wound. <br /> <br /> The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session, in which three men take turns banging their heads and a second sequence in which the three Men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the floor. These two scenes are obviously staged and diminish the realism of the rest of the process. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the victim of the ""experiment"" is quite convincing in having pain and takes a lot of it with abuse and gross things in front of the camera. Her reactions, how she strapped headphones to her head and loud noises for hours are played, are frightening. Some of the other maltreatments she takes are suspended in a net from a tree during the only time they rest. There is also a disturbing scene in which the giggling kidnappers go through their bowels and another nasty greasy scene where they spin in an office chair and are forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until they puke. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this series. I hope I helped you decide if you want to give this episode a chance or not. 8.5 / 10 for Devil's experiment."

I'm looking forward to the second season of this show later that they decided to bring David Spade to this show because he starred in the NBC series ""Just Shoot Me!"" Was finished.

Ken, a rock'n'roll fanatic, marries Kyoto, a Japanese girl, so she can stay in the United States when her visa expires. The marriage is only expected temporarily until Kyoto becomes legal again. But Ken, who seems to be lost in every respect, likes Kyoto and is eager to get things going. That's bad for Rock'n'Roll, despite his friend's insistence on stifling Kyoto and getting rid of all obligations to girls, just to inspire some broken-hearted songwriting and all that. <br /> <br /> But Kyoto comes from a strict traditional Japanese education, and does not expect to be married to Ken for so long. Not only that, she is homesick and wants to return to Japan. It is sad that this is someone Ken believes he can love and be with all that except that he thinks he has found someone who feels that the girl does not expect to stay that long , It's not that she does not like Ken, it's just that she's used to a completely different way of life. She says, ""I can not tell him how I feel in English, and Ken can not tell me how he feels in Japanese."" It's a pretty sad love story with a killer techno Nintendo soundtrack. <br /> <br /> I recorded Loving on Tokyo Time because it reminds me of one of my favorite 80s movies, Tokyo Pop.

After the disappointing US production The Protector, directed by James Glickenhaus, Jackie took the concept and placed it in Hong Kong. This is also likely to be Jackie's most violent film, with the audience writhing in the bone-breaking stunts. <br /> <br /> The action is fast and furious, Jackie and his crew have really put a lot of effort into the fight design. Bones have been broken and blood shed in making this movie, as you will see in the credits. <br /> <br /> The script is a simple cops and robbers affair, nothing special, after all it was written around the action. I have to say that the English version has some dubious dubbing, but it should not distract you too much. <br /> <br /> So, round up the guys, crack the beers and enjoy.

Maybe you have a story and then you put some sex in it. But they did not even do that ... and Anna Paquin is a dizzy lout-slut. Either she's shit or her character is shit, I can not figure out what. <br /> <br /> Another part of the story that I find highly unbelievable is why the 150 year old vampire Bill, who seems to have his stuff together, would be interested in someone like Sookie. She constantly flies away from him to control things he can not control. He goes for two days and she already decides that he ""will not come back"" and suddenly has feelings for dog men? Give me a break. She should be a 25-year-old woman, not a 14-year-old girl. People who are close to her die everywhere, and she has the brightest smile on her face because she just gave away her V card to a buddy because she can not read his thoughts? As the protagonist of the story, I hoped that the show would do a little more to make it understandable, and someone you're interested in, not someone you secretly keep hoping, will be killed or put into a coma.

All these films are made with the same idea; Because the film has no plot, they try to make up for it by filling it with jokes. I'm not saying the jokes are bad, but they make up most of the movie. The first time I saw the movie, I would have given it 1/10.

They also have mouths on them who utter words that make a sailor blush, especially the teenage daughter. <br /> <br /> In addition to the above, as if that was not enough, the plot - and it's so skinny you could read it thoroughly - has a hole the size of Alaska. <br /> <br /> Ma is conspiring to sell her rundown farm. As it turns out, Pa is also. Now, I do not pretend to be a real estate expert, but the last time I checked, real estate that they have in common has to have both signatures to be sold. If only one of them owned the property, then the other could not legally sell it, so it would be pointless for that person to do so. Mr. Shepherd prefers to ignore this fundamental fact, and therefore his action does not work. <br /> <br /> Not that anything else really worked. <br /> <br /> The Only Possible Reason Someone Could See This movie is when they are absolutely desperate to see James Woods in full frontal nudity, and I can not imagine why anyone wants that ,"

Her agent lures him away to New Orleans to teach him to sing opera, but comes to regret this rash decision when the singers fall in love.","Cheerful hyper-joyful '50s cheerfulness, which gives the asocial, pathological behavior a new meaning. Danza and Grayson will ask for mercy. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that all the people involved in this movie are now dead (or in nursing homes). I somehow thought of condemning her for torture. As this movie began to unleash its shamelessly aggressive operatic attack on my poor, defenseless eardrums, I immediately felt strong pains enveloping my whole being. This damn muscular vibrato can smash Soviet tanks into tiny pieces, forget about glass. <br /> <br /> Why did not you switch the channel if you did not like it? A good point, a good point ... The answer is that I wanted it, but the pain was so sudden and agonizing that I fell to the ground in pain, trying to catch my last ounces of energy I could not reach the remote control though. <br /> <br /> A cute little fisherman with the questionable talent of singing with an annoying opera voice is spotted by Niven, who then goes on to ""pigmalionize"" him. Lanza is in love with the asymmetrical Grayson, but she treats him with disdain as expected, until they finally hook in. That may seem like a pretty thin plot, but this loud movie is so full of vocals and music that there is hardly any dialogue Film is Relentless Forget the torture of hippies and prisoners of war with Slayer's ""Reign In Blood"" (as in a South Park episode) Whatever the silent conversation among the stupid adults, this weird music everything is infantile - as if they were all 6 years old posing as adults. I can only envy people who find movies like these funny. It must be great, easy to please: what a world of wonderment would open up to me if only I could enjoy a silly old gag as a hilarious, extravagant comedy. <br /> <br /> But let's take a look at this phenomenon, the musical of the 50s. My best guess is that 50's musicals have offered the more daydreaming idealists among us a look in Utopia or the sky (depending on whether you go to church or go to Lenin's tomb), or at least a very cheesy version of that fantasy , inspired places. TTONO is more a representation of hell, but that's just me. I do not like musicals. People talk, there is a story - but suddenly every four minutes they start to sing, whereupon they suddenly calm down and pretend that nothing unusual has happened! If you think about it, musicals are weirder than science fiction movies. <br /> <br /> Worse, TTONO (my favorite pizza, by the way) is not just a 1950s musical, but also one with screeching operas. Opera is proof that there is such a thing as over-training a voice - to the point where it becomes a piercing weapon, rather than a means to please the listener. The clearest example of this travesty is when Lanza and Grayson combine their Dark Side vocal powers for a truly unbearable duet. I tried to decrease the volume. I lowered it from 18 to 14. Then from 14 to 10. Then 8. I ended up lowering it to a 1, which is usually low enough to be heard only by specially trained dogs and certain types of marsupials nevertheless, I could hear that the two scream like donkeys! <br /> <br /> Take the scene in the small boat in the river. Danza starts with one of his deafening, mind-racking tunes and then ... nothing. No animals to see anywhere. Even the crocodiles, who are mostly deaf, have almost disappeared. If you look closely, you can even see how the trees turn from green to yellow in just a few minutes. No, that was not a continuity error, it was simply old torture of the flora. And these trees were just dull pictures! Imagine how real trees would have reacted. <br /> <br /> The reason why glass breaks up when a high C is torn out of the overweight belly of an opera writer is not due to any laws of physics regarding waves and frequency, but because glass is only human - so it can just take so much pain before it commits suicide by spontaneous self-explosion. I can hear the loudest, most rude Death Metal band for hours, but just give me a minute of soprano and I get a headache."

Now this movie is not for everyone, its mostly silly humor like zoolander or dodgeball; If you hate these movies, I would probably recommend you to stay clear. All in all, it was an entertaining movie about a group of would-be superheroes who eventually became real heroes. It's a very overrated comedy that many people probably have not seen yet, because, as I expected before the viewing, it looked like utter garbage. After watching this movie, I finally understand why this movie was able to put together such a superstars cast that includes Ben Stiller, William H.

Because they were recorded in the poets' paradise long before they made this film. <br /> <br /> I imagine both of them being brought to trial during the last judgment and saying casually to an angry God: I apologize, sir. Do you want to know what we did during our lifetime? Well, well, you'll see: we've directed and produced: I know where I'm going, Colonel Blimp, Red Shoes ?? Do you think that's enough sir? It is quite obvious that these two great artists have already fulfilled their duty to God, Nature of the Muse, or Whatever you call it, when they shot a matter of life and death.

It's the first time I've tried this, but I'm having trouble getting through without occasional breaks. That's not because it's intense, but because it's bad. <br /> <br /> It's almost painfully tedious and unbelievable, especially when the supernaturally robust dying brother Ryan (Colm Feore) is tragic and bitchy on the screen, self-loving and self-pitying. That would have been a much better movie if they'd just let that character out of the story. <br /> <br /> He adds nothing but grumpy, maudlin, very irritating melodrama. Maybe someone decided that if they did not convince Ryan they would only make him offensive. The problem with that is, who cares if a spoiled, whining, disgusting idiot dies? Not me. <br /> <br /> The ONLY thing this character has for him is the fact that he is dying and I'm sorry, but that's just not enough. Dying does not make anyone special. We all die sooner or later. It does not give anyone the right to expect sympathy while behaving like an idiot. <br /> <br /> The other two characters and the actors they play (David Cubitt as Theo and Chandra West as Sarah) are much more interesting, and their story, without Ryan's self-pitying interruptions, would have a much better movie made.

Farnsworth is superb in a stoic but sympathetic way, letting the stories he hears on his journey become part of his life, and Sissy Spacek gives some of her best work in a smaller role than his mentally challenging but attentive daughter The mystery reveals itself in a poignant way by a gentle twist in the sensitive writing of John Roach and Mary Sweeney), but the rest of the small cast of a person delivers indelible achievements, one of the most notable being Barbara Robertson, whose accidental killing of a deer is simultaneous maudlin and sad at the same time.

If an egg is fertilized it will remain within that thickened lining for nourishment. But if the egg is not fertilized, the body has no use for the extra nourishment, and it passes out of the body - which is the process called menstruation.

I was intrigued and thought it was one of the best books I've read lately. When I rented the DVD, I was intrigued to see how this adaptation was measured. Unfortunately, the movie did not even come close to creating the ambience or developing the characters that Orwell did so masterfully in his book. The director seems to think that anyone watching the movie has read the book because he does not try to show WHY the characters act and feel the way they do. John Hurt, the lead actor, is droll all the way and barely plays until the end. We never really experience what he does for a living, or why his love relationship is forbidden, or what the political climate is and why the protagonist wants rebellion. This book can not cope in film without proper narrative and explanation of the political system that oppresses the characters, and the fact that they are missing is the biggest drawback of this film. Apart from that, John Hurt was a horrible casting candidate and looked about 15 years older than the 39-year-old Winston he should portray. On the plus side, the rest of the cast was well-chosen.

The story itself, an autobiography with Sanders as a lovable jewel thief, Francois Eugene Vidocq, who becomes a police chief but can barely resist the temptation of his jewels, is entertaining enough, but it has the same kind of hollow historic Hollywood treatment that has defaced such Time epics like * Marie Antoinette * and certainly the deplorable * Forever Amber * (screaming for a classic remake). Although Sanders tries to give his character a certain depth in his defense, everything is in vain. I'm an outrageous Douglas-Sirk fan, but that's 1946, and it's one of Sirk's earliest American pursuits that misses many of the typical details that would define his flowery, chest-hard potboilers. Sirk just wet his feet here and made a series of nondescript films over the next decade, until he won gold with * Magnificent Obsession *, and shot us with estrogen celebrations like * All That Heaven * * Worn On The Wind * and imitation of life *. But * Scandal in Paris * is hardly his best work ?? a relatively low-budget affair with cheesy sets and ineffective costumes."

It's too long; Some of the content may have been saved for the sequel to Barry McKenzie Holds His Own, which urgently needed new things. Granted, his ocher-Australian attitude is funny, but also gets annoying when the movie gets dressed. Some say Crocker's songs are the best pieces, and they are certainly original, but ""hilarious""? The adventures of Barry McKenzie will be considered a milestone in Australian cinema, but we should do everything in our power to ensure that Australian audiences do not see the majority of Australians as Barry McKenzies (or Mick Dundees!). , Rating: 5/10"

I guess these people do not look much of T.V. from the USA, who pat the sitcom model down. No, here we have to do something else, we have to make the A story absurd and then have a meaningful B story to make up for it. The characters are two-dimensional and the storylines are way over the top: forklift racing ??? give me a damn break. Here is a small piece of advice for the show's authors: Do not write funny situations, find the funny thing in situations. And remember, you have to be born with a sense of humor to write really funny stuff, and not just an improviser."

Kane against MVP. That was a good game. Nothing about wrestling here. This was about the visuals. Overall, that was not bad. There were a few close points here with Kane getting too close to the fire, but in the end Kane got back into the fire with ramming MVP first. <br /> <br /> Nice opener. Let us continue. <br /> <br /> Teddy Long announces a new match for the tag team titles: London and Kendrick will defend themselves against: Regal and Taylor, The Hardyz and MNM IN A LEADER MATCH !!!! Here we go! <br /> <br /> Match 2: Fatal 4-way ladder match. That was total carnage. If you start from three of the four teams here, you would expect chaos. The spots were fantastic. A total spot party. One point Jeff went for Poetry in Motion and London moved and Jeff met the ladder! Shortly thereafter, Jeff sits with two ladders near the top rope when MNM wanted to kill Jeff, Matt rescues and Jeff meets Joey Mercury! Mercury is hurt. His eye is closed quickly and opened the hard way. Mercury is taken out of the game and Nitro is still there. He will fight alone for the titles! Regal and Taylor then grab London and carry it face-first into the ladder! Jeff climbs the ladder and nitro in a killer spot, dropkicks through the ladder to nail Jeff! Brilliant! In the end, London and Kendrick retain the tag team title. What a game !!! <br /> <br /> That was crazy. I can not imagine why WWE has not announced that yet. The Buyrate would rise enormously. I'm sure the replay value will be good. <br /> <br /> Mercury has suffered a damaged nose and tears on the eye. He is in the hospital now. Get well soon, child. <br /> <br /> There is no other way to do that. <br /> <br /> Above: The Miz v. Boogeyman. (Ugh) That was not appropriate. Will the Boogeyman ever wrestle? The Miz is too shit. After an insane crowd, they are killed by it. DUD. <br /> <br /> Chris Benoit against Chavo. That was a strong match. I enjoyed it. Chavo hit a Killer Superplex at one point! Benoit has also met eight German suplexes! Benoit wins with the sniper. Good things. <br /> <br /> Helms v. Yang Cruiserweight title championship game. That was a good match. Unfortunately, the stupid fans did not care. WHY? Helms and Yang are very talented and have done well. I agree with JBL. He ran to the crowd. JBL is 100% correct. Learn to appreciate or get out. <br /> <br /> Mr. Kennedy v. The Undertaker Last Ride Game. Not too much here. This was a snail party, with a few exceptions. Kennedy threw Taker from the top of the stage to the floor. The place was ok. The reaction was disappointing. The final spot was Taker Tombstone Kennedy on the hearse and won the game. Unreal. Kennedy needed that victory. Both work hard. Nevertheless, Kennedy needed this victory. The undertaker should have lost. Creative is screwed up again. <br /> <br /> A stupid diva thing is coming next. I like women. Not that. At least Torrie was not here. That's refreshing. Judging by the crowd, Layla should have won. The WWE wanted Ashley. Think of this as your bathroom break. Continue. <br /> <br /> Main Event: Cena & Batista Vs. Finlay & Booker T. That was not suitable. The focus was on Cena v. Finlay and Batista v. Booker. Batista and Booker can not work well together. Finlay tries to make Cena look good. The finish was botched. Finlay hit Batista with a chair and Batista could not sell the shot and ended the match. Lame. No main event caliber. <br /> <br /> Overall, Armageddon would have scored less, but Ladder Match was the main event. That was worth enough money right there. A few others were solid. <br /> <br /> The last word: A good PPV with the ladder match as a savior. Smackdown is not a bad show, just not compelling enough. Smackdown has to stop bringing Cena along. Let Smackdown stand on her own legs. This show proves that Smackdown can."
8,tt0404802,1,"Portrait of an American innocent. In 1955, Bettie Page (1923-2008 ) waits to testify before a Senate subcommittee investigating the effects of pornographic material on American adolescents and juveniles. In flashbacks, we see her childhood in Tennessee, a brief marriage, a gang rape, and her going to New York City in 1949. There she takes acting lessons, models for photos, and acts in short films for adults, earning the nickname, ""The Pin-Up Queen of the Universe."" We see her relationship with merchants Irving and Paula Klaw, photographers John Willie and Bunny Yeager, boyfriends, and the public. Through it all, she is wholesome, sporting, and forthright - Eve before the fall.","I have known Bettie Page for many years. The soft-core porn pictures of her from the 1950s are now iconographic and still have a strong relationship today. Even in the hetero-fetish world, the ""Bettie Page"" look is still very popular and remains as unique as it was then. So I saw this movie with a certain familiarity. The result did not disappoint. <br /> <br /> Among other things, it was very entertaining to see the actual characters of the film such as Irving Klaw, John Willie and Bunny Yeager. Everyone looks at the trailblazer today. Mary Harron did an excellent job of creating the desired ambience of sexual repression and hypocrisy in America in the 1950s, along with a sexuality that was innocent by today's standards. I particularly liked the use of monochrome over color as a visual shorthand for the emotional and spiritual climate Bettie was in. <br /> <br /> I think Gretchen Mol did an excellent job of portraying Bettie's character in all of her innocent sexuality and all her naivety. Bettie loved to look pretty, loved the attention, did not see anything wrong with nudity and enjoyed getting dressed in ""silly outfits"" for the camera. The underlying sexuality and the deeply fetishistic desires were completely lost in her. To this day, she still does not understand ""what the fuss was about"" when it comes to her pictures or her S & M content. <br /> <br /> That's not to say that she's uneducated or too simple. I just understand that she just does not understand fetishism and will never do it. No harm there. Bettie Page is just who she is. The film captured that very nicely. <br /> <br /> The social atmosphere of the 1950s, presented by Mrs. Harron and written by her with Guinevere Turner, really makes me happy that I live in the day and the age that I am doing. The hypocrisy and oppression, combined with the massive ignorance of our sexuality, combined into a frighteningly overwhelming world. The movie captures that and cheers her, while Bettie endures everything with her unshakable faith and steady naivety. <br /> <br /> This movie was sometimes a bit slow, but hit all the points that Mrs. Harron tried and hit her well. I would even recommend this film for those people who do not even know who Bettie Page was and what effect she had on American culture. For those with such interests, this movie is a must."

I remember it was one of the first Warner Cinema features, a process called Warnerscope, which provided a very neat cinematography. Shelley Winters and Jack Palance earned an Oscar for their performances. The only thing I could criticize was that I was not instructed by someone like, say Nicholas Ray, to increase his rhythm and tension."

I can not blame them - they have been given a script of such banal banality that they can only walk with pain behind their eyes, which has nothing to do with the evil processes in SummersIsle. <br /> <br /> There's no moment in this movie that's true - not an honest line or a single moment of being moved.

3,tt0421660,0,"While undergoing open heart surgery, a man's failed anesthetic leaves him completely alert, but paralyzed and unable to tell his doctors","From the beginning, this film had a few shortcomings. The protagonist of Hayden Christensen is a wealthy young mogul who has inherited his father's considerable wealth and power, and he struggles to fill his father's shoes and cut the apron that keeps mom (and co-manager) too tight. He also has the problem of having heart disease and waiting in the limbo, which is the organ donor registry. There are also little background stories that largely ignore her first instincts that later became important, such as his friendship with his surgeon (Terrence Howard) and his romance with a middle-class girl (Jessica Alba). Uncreative storylines, but not bad enough to ruin the movie. The only true ""Oy Vey!"" Moment was the name of Lena Olin's character. Overbearing woman named Lilith ... subtle! <br /> <br /> The surgical scenes are not censored at all. I appreciate that people who find surgery scenes scary may not. The horror of being awake during anesthesia was initially well done. They watch in emotional agony as Christensen screams inside through the chest cut and the rib spreader. The moment of irony of the followers comes when he is one of the unfortunate few awake during anesthesia, but he is also fortunate that it helps him to learn that his surgical team is planning to assassinate him. <br /> <br The big shoot, however, is very predictable and lets the movie invade the plot and its memories of the little characters that were there, but he, like us, initially missed. <br /> <br /> There are two more twists at the end of his relationship with his mother. One of them is an impressive gesture from Olin, which makes so little impression because of the bad writing. The other is a mystery about the family's past, which seemed very touched and meaningless. <br /> <br /> The initially well-done anesthesia-consciousness drama is lost in the poorly written conspiracy drama. There is one last attempt to bring it back, which falls flat and takes the entire movie with it."

Not only does this film look cheap, it's cheap too - most of the combat scenes are from the far superior ""The Last Command"" of 1955, and the material recorded 32 years ago is more contemporary than anything on this picture. The few action scenes actually filmed for this film are disorganized, confused and incompetent and look just as shabby as the rest of the picture. This has the look of a bad student movie (and the budget does not seem to be much more). It moves like molasses, the plot is mostly either exaggerated ham or below the surface comatose - although Raul Julia performs better than most of the other performers - and it's full of trouble historical inaccuracies. In addition, it is far too long. If you want to make a boring movie, do it in an hour or so and put it behind you - do not stretch it out over three hours, as is the case here.

The touch of the occult makes this movie one of the best horror parodies of all time. It's a well-made movie with a terrific spectacle by all the actors; including Edie McClurg and Jeff Conaway (from ""Grease""). There are also beautiful special effects.

Demons have infested Edo, taking possession of earthly forms and subjecting them to their unholy will. In addition, the rebirth of Ashura, Queen of Demons, is near.

Their destinies are intertwined (literally) and they are bound by fate to be lovers and enemies. <br /> <br /> If you think this sounds like your typical Japanese fantasy / swordplay epic, you're wrong. In fact, there is nothing typical about Ashura. It's a smorgasbord of many different genres of the movie. The just mentioned, as well as a comedy, drama and romance. Director Yojiro Takita (Onmyoji) juggles the genre quite respectfully (though the comedy seems forced in some scenes) and the end result is a ridiculous but really funny popcorn movie. <br /> <br /> Of course there are mistakes in the movie. Some of the humor seems to be invented and out of place. And action is not the greatest thing. But seriously, are you watching fantasy / swordplay / comedy films for the great acting performances? No, we see her for the action and crazy CG visuals that Ashura has in spades. Not to be misled, the movie is not just action, but generously cut with lots of sword fighting and buckets of green blood to make the average viewer happy. <br /> <br /> Bottom line; The film has its faults and is not a martial arts epic, but it does not try to be and it offers interesting visuals and good sword fighting action. The reason the movie worked for me is that it never takes itself too seriously and if the spectator does the same, he will surely love this funny and silly sword fighting fantasy action strip. <br /> <br /> My rating 7 out of 10.

The cast is perfectly chosen, although Scott Wolf does not look like a father of an eight-year-old, even if he wears a suit.

The passionate story of the Chinese princess Turandot, and the mysterious three riddles which are the key to her heart, are on the lips of opera buffs throughout the city.

Stefan, a young gay East German medical student, arrives in the city for a medical congress and is following the trail of his dead father, a once high ranking AIDS researcher in the East. Stefan is investigating whether the HIV virus was an incremental result of secret human experiments that were conducted in US prisons in the seventies - a thesis of the Berlin professor Jakob Segal, which was spread by state agents of former East Germany. Secret lists involving these biological experiments are rumored to have surfaced in San Francisco. Stefans main contact person is being killed in an illegal club, right ...","Jochen Hick wrote and directed this little thriller of an exciting movie based on the concept that the AIDS virus is a government-mutated sheep virus designed to rid the world of gays and apparently in the years leading up to the onset of the terrible disease Convicts was tested. Without the sharpness of the concept of film, this would fall into the category of many films about the destruction of the world by a rampant, non-biased infectious organism. <br /> <br /> Stefan (Tom Wlaschiha) Traveling from Berlin to San Francisco to study his father's scientific assumptions about the induced sheep virus and its effects on the convicts into whom it was infused. He encounters some contempt and resistance to a dead theory, but also meets some people who know the theory and support his investigation. Simultaneously with his visit, there will be a series of serial killings in which every victim will be killed in a similar manner and accompanied by every murder of Puccini's opera ""Turandot"", which is currently opening at the San Francisco Opera. A police investigator Louise Tolliver (Irit Levi) and her attendant policeman (Kalene Parker) are following the murders as Stefan goes around the sex clubs and bars in San Francisco trying to locate men who may have been guinea pigs for his father's theory , He encounters a strange guy Jeffrey (Jim Thalman), with whom he has an attraction for cats and mice, and a prominent Doctor Burroughs (Richard Conti), who seems strangely involved in the occupation of suspects. How it all ends is the game of the film, a story so much about the search for identity between Stefan and Jeffery, as it is for the investigation of murders. <br /> <br /> While Tom Wlaschiha, Jim Thalman and Richard Conti are good with their roles (they're the only three who already have acting experience in this movie!), the quality of the film drops considerably by the less than acceptable Minimal talented Irit Levy and Kaylene Parker: when they are screen the credibility of the story falls below zero. There are some little cameos from other actors that brighten the screen for the moments they inhabit, but throughout the movie he is suffocated by the incessant repetition of ""Nessun dorma"" as Mario del Monaco sang from a recording of the opera - and that seems to be the reason for the movie!

Into her life comes Paul Angeli, a new trainee she decides to hire. Paul is 25 years old and completely unskilled, but Carla covers for him when the need arises because of his other qualities - he's a thief, fresh out of jail and very good-looking. It's a case of good meeting bad.","This film has a rotting core of flexible morals and yet a stubborn sense of justice. So many of the regular Joe's among us would love to ""stick to the MAN"". The ""MAN"" is represented in this case by several different characters. Mr. Keller, about whom Carla reports in her office. Later, Paul owes Mr. Marchand the club owner. And then there's Paul's probation officer. There seem to be so many questions about the side story of this last character. Reviewers point out that this is a weakness in an otherwise very successful underground ping-pong game between our two protagonists, escalating their tits until their lives change dramatically. They are committed to every agent of the ""MAN"". One or both can be fired, killed or imprisoned if they do not do as they are told. <br /> <br /> The film has a sense of relief at the end. Carla is finally laid. Your boss is forced to be an idiot. Mr. Club owner is a mushy mess in his own bathroom. You get the $ money $. And ... they do not need to worry about reporting to the probation officer because HIS moral weakness leads him to hide his wandering wife in the basement (or whatever the police found to arrest him). It's a critical unconscious trigger for the castle glass that made us so tight. It does not matter that someone else gets Paul's file later to oversee his release; For the moment they are free!

Students, already under pressure to perform in the classroom, on the track, or in front of their friends, are strained to the breaking point by prejudice, inexperience, and misunderstanding.","Higher learning is a slap in the face for those of us who have been in the closet for too long, regardless of their ethnic background. It is an issue that most of us would like to ignore, but we can not afford it if there is a real progressive change in the way we can accept and understand diversity. Some have criticized this film as hateful or stupid. It is about ignorance prevailing in the world and some continuing to dominate our society.

Soles did not become a big star after playing Riff Randall, number 1 in punk rock group Ramones, at Rock'n'Roll High School. Soles is so effusive that she does not mind that she's obviously too old to be in high school (this fact is offset by the fact that all the kids look 24). The film is a fast-paced joke that does not excite; In the end, everything is torn to pieces, and so it should be. Mary Voronov, a naturally kinky and witty presence as a Nazi-style headmistress, gets a great, unique piece at the beginning, where frisbees fly dangerously close to her head (how many takes did she use, right?) Was it a lucky hit ?) and Dey Young is very appealing as Soles best, Kate Rambeau. The weakest link, ironically, in this ""high school"" chain group are the Ramones. They can not play, they are not funny, and their concert segment takes too long. A Ramones song, ""I Want You Around,"" is treated like a fantasy and is well captured; other minor songs are good, especially a rare Paul McCartney ballad that was heard at the beginning (""Have we ever met?"").

This reason is: it's shit! It's a very pointless, dull, feeble-minded and totally unthinkable horror comedy / parody. To be honest, I'm not even sure if that was meant as a comedy, because sometimes the script takes itself seriously and really tries to be a really ambitious and original horror game of the late 80's. In 1909, at the beginning of a new era in medical science, Dr. Elliot Hackenstein according to the opening sequences exactly three women? no more and no less ?? to renovate his beloved wife, whom he accidentally killed. She is now just a living head, but the stupid body-eaters only supply male carcasses. So, if Dr. Hacking screams, ""I need to bring back three female bodies to my wife,"" his words are not even cold and it miraculously only three young women appear (and a really annoying nerdy kid) with problems with the car pointing at his front door. Why does not that happen to me? ""I need a bunch of sexy voluptuous women to fill my empty harem !!!"" ?? See nothing! Anyway, the good doctor sees his wish fulfilled, but unfortunately? for science that is ?? he develops sympathy for one of the three girls. ""Dr. Hacking ""is a lame movie that seeks to steal on the success of"" Re-Animator ""and even blatantly stealing some of the weird aspects of this classic one-of-a-kind talking headset. It's easy to understand why this movie is not mentioned anywhere because it does not appeal to fans of horror or comedy. The funniest figure is undoubtedly the loud-talking grave robber Ruby; presented by the anti-cherubic Anne Ramsey. The horror fans of the '80s will certainly remember Wes Craven's ""Deadly Friend"", where she plays the nasty old neighbor beheaded by a basketball. ""Dr. Hackenstein"" is said to take place in the early 1900s, but there are few attempts to recreate the atmosphere of that era (except perhaps for some cars). Dr. Hackenstein's lab is a pretty stereotypical '80s set, with all sorts of smoky cauldrons and test tubes full of fluorescent colors."

Unfortunately, the characters have to be developed so that the public really cares about the mortals, otherwise all you have is a series of arbitrary acts of violence. The problem is especially aggravated if you have many characters who all die. <br /> <br /> OK, so if you do not care about making the characters somehow memorable or sympathetic, you can at least PLEASE REASON why they die plausibly, right? Nope. Here we have a war between two Ninja clans, where no side really knows WHY they are fighting. They kill each other because the Emperor says that. But even after it becomes apparent that the Emperor wants to see ALL dead, they still refuse to give up their meaningless missions. That's no stubbornness ... that's just stupid. <br /> <br /> Good, good! There is no character development and the plot does not provide a sound reason for the fight. At least they die in cool action scenes, right? Again, NO! In fact, many of the fights are not even battles: Super Ninjas, who has spent so much time and effort on film, suddenly die (and lame, in my opinion). I'm talking about things like, ""Lalala, I'm running with you and I - * the neck is slashed *."" The end for this character.

In the Stargate universe, people were enslaved by the Goa'uld, such as Ra and Apophis, and transported to habitable planets. For thousands of years, the Goa'uld have been harvesting humanity and influencing and spreading human cultures. As a result, earth cultures such as the Aztecs, Mayans, British, Scandinavians, Mongols, Greeks and Romans are found in the known habitable planets of the galaxy. Many well-known mythical places like Avalon, Camelot and Atlantis were found or existed earlier. <br /> <br /> Currently the Earth's Stargate (found at an excavation site near Giza in 1928) is housed in a top-secret US military base known as SGC (Stargate Command) under Cheyenne Mountain.

The original archenemy of this race was the system owner Apophis (Peter Williams). Other system owners, such as Baal and Anubis, play a central role in the later seasons. The ninth season features a new villain, the Ori. The Ori are advanced beings with unfathomable technology from another galaxy who are also focused on galactic conquest and eternal worship. The introduction of the Ori is a departure from the primary focus on Egyptian mythology in an exploration of the Arthurian mythology around the Ori, their followers and their enemies."

Was she protecting her father, who half-blown, as it were, when he fiercely launched a malicious trial? Was she protecting herself, with her reputation suddenly alarming, if only her art mattered? During the trial, this strong-willed woman turns to mush before our eyes. Conversely, her lover, who begins as a narcissistic idiot, becomes a selfless hero during the process.

Although the conclusions of these films are darker, I feel that the themes are somewhat related; that freedom and individualism are very important and that there is usually someone who wants to take it away from you. The other common feature of these films is the caring, thoughtful 'guardian angel' types that help the main characters overcome adversity. <br /> <br /> Another review here mentions how this film refers to the theme of civilization invading a home. You just have to look at the dwindling open spaces around us to see that. <br /> <br /> I loved the animation and the story, the entertainers really got the horses to look, act and move in a natural way. Spirit's emotions were very clear as the story progressed (yes, I'm aware that they are humanizing the horses a bit, but that's fiction). In some action scenes you feel trapped in the current of the rapids and the heat of a forest fire. In other quiet scenes (which are most of the time) you can enjoy the backgrounds. One of the great things that makes history work is that you do not go on the talking, singing animal route. This would escape the power of history. Instead, the storyline is told through occasional narrations of the main character, and the fantastic soundtrack adds even more. Another plus is that they were not afraid to tell the story something of a dark side (which made this film truly tangible to me). However, this is not common throughout the movie, and the conclusion is fitting and uplifting without being sappily. <br /> <br /> Those who appreciate horses will really like this movie, but I think it's a bit more than a horse movie. I do not think that this would be a good movie to take children with if they grew up with the filthy food that is being offered today. But if they are the thoughtful kind who can handle compelling stories like The Lord of the Rings and Black Beauty, they'll probably love this movie. Damn, I'm 35 years old and love the stuff."

Landing in the Australian outback she meets a surveyor and they cross the continent together. However, she spends the trip haranguing him for the ecological recklessness and avarice of the human race.","EPSILON, ALENSE VISITOR, is not what I expected. This is an Australian no-budget movie with no special effects except for an accelerated movie and fast scene cuts. The female alien (who is immediately able to speak perfectly accented Australians) can ""flick"" from place to place or from time to time and change her perception of the flow of time to suit the ""faster"" human. <br /> <br /> An elderly grandmother tells her two granddaughters about a story a traveling man told her 40 years ago, when a nameless ""she"" came naked and completely disoriented to the planet and could not tell from what a star in the sky she came ...

In another amusing metaphor, Earthlings are ""frogs."" <br /> <br /> From then on, it's a dialogue about dialogue as the perplexed man tries to understand them. She is a peculiar psychology and points of view, even if she calls him unintelligent ""quaint"". The man begins to realize that it may be people who are irrational and do not think straight. But while she waits to be ""beamed up"" at home, she sees that this person is not completely flawed in his thinking and even falls in love with him. <br /> <br /> The dialogue about perspectives is interesting in points, but it's all superimposed with a lumbering environmental message and a low-budget feeling (there are only two main characters flashing around various deserted scenes and the evil people on the planet are never seen). The environmental message offers no solutions, but paints one or two terrible metaphors about what will happen to nature and man when something is not done. The logic is not related either: the rest of the universe has ""given up"" on earth, but a spacewoman mistakenly trapped on Earth manages to make a positive change by completing the film.

I do not know if Chávez is everything he is, or another in the long line of populist Latin American caudillos. I also do not know if he will be able to meet the great expectations he has clearly built among the poor majority of Venezuelans. It is hardly reasonable to expect such a film to answer such questions - but I now have a pretty vivid idea of ​​what is at stake and what it feels like to be caught in the middle of a coup d'état.

The next time it was on, I took care to record it so I could watch it over and over, and it has remained one of my favorite pieces. In the first few minutes you realize that the audience is not sure what to think, but he quickly wins them with his incredible humor and wit. While many stand-up comedians come together in my head, Eddie Izzard stands out as one of the best. His style is incredibly refreshing, and it's nice to hear jokes about things like history and puberty when most comedians stay current events. His show stayed with me afterwards.

Charlie Korsmo's first really big role, except ""What's up with Bob?"". At that time, the makeup effects were up to date and mostly still hold. Beautiful scenery and mood put you right in a comic environment. The cars, the cloakroom, the buildings, and even the street lights are a great sound, not to mention the perfect lighting, though the scenes with lots of red can get a little annoying as it tends to blur a little.

If such a war takes place on a small island that almost immediately becomes a traitor, there is no war in the open air. The soldiers are sent to the front line to fight on the mainland, while another kind of war takes place at home on the small island. There, neighbors tell neighbors, sometimes because their political views contradict the new regime, but many people are informed about old family struggles, or maybe the silent introvert who has no friends will be told by someone who wants to ""earn some points"". And these things do not happen outdoors. There were some attempts, true, but many other times people would only be woken up in the middle of the night, taken from their homes to the nearest graveyard, where they would be killed. And the next morning, the bodies would be found, and people would have an idea of ​​what had happened, but no one would dare to say or do anything. We're not talking about soldiers killing someone they've never seen in their lives. We talk about people killing their neighbors, and probably said hello to their widow the next day, and also attend the funeral for the guy she killed. We speak of villages with one to two thousand inhabitants, where everyone knows each other. <br /> <br /> I come from this little island and I heard the stories my grandparents told me, and I have to say that the film upset me, oh yes, it did; but I also found it remarkably beautiful and moving. The initial violence is not something that the director or the writer invented, so it happened in this war. A child who knows that his partner's father is in the fascist group that killed his father? Totally possible. All this happened later? Possible too. TB was real too. At that time, my island was not the resort it became. The people were poor, illiterate and worked in small farms. After the war there were times of need. <br /> <br /> So, you will not find a war story in this movie, or at least not the kind of war story you expect. There are no battlefields, no soldiers, no political intrigues. This is the meanest kind of war that happens when space is limited (just check the size of the island), when neighbors fight with their neighbors, when members of the same family fight against each other, and they live in a place where everyone is everyone knows. You will find a story about the harm that this particular kind of war can cause to humans and the history of how they may or may not survive this damage. <br /> <br /> I have to mention the excellent work done by the writers who adapted the novel and by all the actors who could really sound Mallorcan. That was remarkable."

But I was pretty surprised that this whole movie is pretty serious. Acting is decent and serious all the time. No jokes are played by teenagers or something. And the music, at first I thought, was pretty good. It added some horror and also something ""classic"", with the use of menacing violins and everything. But in the course of the film, I came to the conclusion that the result was just too ambitious. You did not have to add these threatening violins if you just saw someone getting in a car and then driving away at normal speed. <br /> <br /> Then there is Melissa Sue Anderson who was the main reason for me watching this movie. A few weeks ago I saw her in Happy Birthday To Me, a pretty entertaining, fat (and sometimes silly) Slasher movie that she did the same year as MIDNIGHT OFFLINGS. And I have to say, she was very good as the ice-cold evil witch Vivian. But the main problem with the movie is: almost nothing happens! Vivian causes a death and an accident, yes, but that's it. Then there's Robin, the good witch who's just starting to learn about her powers. And we expect them to use their powers more than once, but on just one occasion, they use their powers to fly some pieces of wood and other material through the air as projectiles. That should be a fight between two powerful witches? And worse, I was hoping to see a spectacular showdown between the witches at the end of the movie, with at least some special effects, blazing eyes or whatever ... but nothing happens. There is a kind of confrontation in the end, but it is a big disappointment. <br /> <br /> Well, the action of the two witches was good. The score was decent (if too ambitious). And the cinematography was sometimes quite dark and moody. But that does not make a good movie, right?"

At the end of the worst day of his life, Bruce angrily ridicules and rages against God and God responds. God appears in human form and, endowing Bruce with divine powers, challenges Bruce to take on the big job to see if he can do it any better.","I was looking forward to seeing this movie because it seemed promising from the upcoming attractions: Jim Carrey with Godlike powers was an idea that definitely worked for me. As a big fan, I was sure that he would be in his element with such a promising premise and what could go wrong? Yesterday my bladder, boys and girls burst because I saw the movie. <br /> <br /> The first act (where it is established that he hates his life, he is an angry employee and an extremely unfortunate camper with an ax to scold against God) is useful, the second act ( where he is called by God over the phone and receives Powers Almighty) is GREAT - Carrey is having fun with his new ""Toys"" and it's a pleasure to see, really funny. But the third act is unbearably bad. <br /> <br /> After the dinner scene between Bruce and his girlfriend Grace (Jennifer Aniston, who performs well in this movie, considering her part only matters, the decay begins Plot device even her NAME stinks of unreliability) - she thinks he'll raise the question, but instead he tells her (still on his knees) that he finally gets his job as a news anchor, and is not it so exciting? <br /> <br /> She does not think so. She wants him to marry her, look, so she undresses and leaves him, look, although she still LOVES him a lot, look, and the rest of the movie is spent with a miserable, frightening head over the To hit his head. After the next there was a spiritual-sounding cliche, until at the end I also prayed. , .for it to be over. <br /> <br /> I did not like the lack of subtlety in the first two acts (an example - in the second act, after he gets his powers, Bruce dances into the room and sings, ""What if God were one of those us, just a slab like one of us "", blah blah blah), and I was even ready to miss the amazing amount of contradictions that are flung towards us (Moran Freeman - a / k / a GOD - tells Bruce that he is it can not go against any free will, but it does so very often - these decisions were forgivable - it's a Jim Carrey comedy directed by Tom Shadyac - it's not The Remains of the Day. <br /> <br Or rather, it was a comedy, when the scriptwriters lose sight of this (in the dreaded act 3) and try to turn the process into a kind of (gag) message movie, what we get instead is hell Bruce recognizes the fault of his selfish nature Well, he recognizes that GRACE is his salvation - must say - grace, and that his priorities in life have been badly misunderstood. All of this, however, could have been much less intrusive. The film did not have to go into the dump truck to make those points. Unfortunately, the writers and Shadyac apparently had no idea how to cleverly and lightly solve the story in any way, so in the hope that we would not notice it, they went to the ""head-over-heads"". -Route. In the end, they even made some surprisingly ugly conclusions, hoping that this would reduce the bad taste. It did not work for me."

He's been around for over 20 years and he shames others in the genre. While he is big in Asia, he is almost unknown here in the US. <br /> <br /> Black Mask is supposed to be a breakout movie for him, but it fails terribly. Above all, it is synchronized. While it can have a stock value (dubbing is not even short and it is flat in tone), it seems inappropriate for the normal movie viewer. Second, the director in this movie, Daniel Lee, does a terrible job. He cuts scenes so fast, sometimes you do not know what's going on. Another time, the camera shakes and shakes. Fans see Jet Lis films for the fantastic martial arts. However, the director handles the scenes so fast that you do not even know who's half the time! At other times, a scene gets stuck (ie, Li starts cutting a hole in the bottom of a jeep while the badguys arm their weapons, two seconds later Li and the love interest are already under the car!) Other scenes are so unlikely that they exceed the point that they are completely ridiculous (Killer CD-ROMs? Just give him Throwing Stars !!!!). Li, he needs a director who is less prone to machine guns and more for a cinematic staging. The added rap / techno music goes from okay to intrusive. The storyline has possibilities, but all are wasted on cartoon characters who take away any credibility that this movie seeks. And should we really believe that the love interest Simon would not recognize because he has a half mask? Would not the hair, the lower jaw or the voice betray it? <br /> <br /> If you want to see a Jet Li movie, try Iron Monkeys or its classic Shaolin Temple.

Unfortunately she ignores him, because she's several years older. Then the hotel guest Charles enters the competition, a slimy twenty-something who lusts for the girl, despite the fact that he's engaged.","I like David Hamilton's artistic photographs of naked women on the border of femininity, sometimes erotic, but never pornographic. Someone else liked her too because my David Hamilton books were stolen. In a book were a few pictures of a boy to see, obviously naked, familiar with a young woman older than him, even naked. Although discreet, there was strong sexual connotation. New territory for David Hamilton, which has proved either as a still from the movie Tendres Cousines or as photos on the set. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, the art of still photography does not automatically translate into cinematography. Soft focus becomes blurry and discrete angles become confusing, perhaps because they can not be considered in motion. You either see it or miss it and there is no time to observe, understand. The movie is meant to be a farce, and fun things happen, but it's not related, maybe because the story is developing so slowly and you can wonder what's going on. Finally, 14-year-old Julien has intercourse with his cousin, but it's soft-core, with no genital contact in front of the camera. Since it is a farce, we have a disappointing virgin and an embarrassing act in the act-gag. After catching her, Julien's father even gives him a cigarette to complete the experience. In fairness, the film is in French and corresponds to French film forms, which are simply too subtle for most Americans, even with English subtitles, to help us Philistines. <br /> <br /> It has been suggested that this film is a child pornography and that certainly stems from today's climate where the sexual exploitation of children is clearly a serious problem. No one in their right mind wants to endorse or support the sexual abuse of children so that there is virtually no room for children to be seen in the mildest erotic context without immediately raising the alarm of sexual violence and exploitation. Guys will think ""Lucky Julien!"" although they agree that sex and children in the movies are a ""bad thing"" while still wishing they could have been a Julien at this age. Women too may have similar thoughts, but all these considerations must be pushed out of consciousness. Hysterically, the worst assumptions have become automatic and matters of children and sex are consistently avoided. Too bad, because the sexual awakening is a real human experience. After all, children grow up and become sexual beings like Julien. It is a fitting literary theme, including cinema, but taboo under the threat of sexual violence against children. I think David Hamilton took a risk of making a movie about the subject even in 1980. He has been somewhat successful in researching this sensitive subject, and unfortunately we will be out of fear of the child pornography label in the near future."

But all have an incredible entertainment value because of their unintentional cheerfulness. The plot of almost every David Prior ""movie"" (as I like to call it) is basically the same. Manly All-American Commandos team up to blow up Communist baddies. But unlike other Cold War-era garbage like Red Dawn, Prior's films are funny because of their exaggerated premises and their acting. The best part of Jungle Assault is the scene in which Becker (or was it the other guy?) Is called by General Mitchell to a top-secret mission in South America. The funniest line in the movie is then delivered, something in the effect of ""this is my roommate, I trained him well"". WHAT. You trained your roommate? And apparently this will be their solution to avoid the eviction. <br /> <br /> If you can find these gems on video used everywhere, buy them. They are all funny and after some beers even funnier.

Now everyone has a keen interest in finding that jacket.","Rene Clair, one of the great directors and great pioneers of cinema, created in Le Million a gem of light comedy, which is a groundbreaking and technically brilliant film, the following filmmakers like the Marx Brothers, Lubitsch, and Mamoulian. The storyline, a witty story of a poor artist who wins a huge lotto jackpot but has to frantically search for the missing ticket all over the city, is basically just a means to a series of wonderfully funny comic scenes in a dream world World support the imagination of the director. <br /> <br /> One of the most impressive things about this film is that, although it plays in the middle of Paris and contains nothing really impossible, it creates a sustainable and engaging fairy-tale / fantastic atmosphere in which it seems quite natural that the People sing as much as they talk, or that a fight over a stolen jacket should take the form of a football game. Another memorable element is that Le Million contains the funniest opera ever released (O this blonde plaited soprano! ""I laugh, ha! Ha!"") Also a pleasure is the casting: Clair has an amazing group put together, sharply different character actors, each with deadly satirical accuracy a bourgeois French ""type"", so that the film appears like a series of Daumier prints. <br /> <br /> The serenity takes a while to roll, and I did not find the characters as emotionally engaging as they may even be in a light comedy (as they are in many Lubitsch films, for example). For these reasons, I refrain from giving it the highest estimate. But these little cavities should not distract from an enthusiastic recommendation. <br /> <br /> Should you see it? By all means. Highly recommended if you want a classic and influential work of cinema or just a fun comedy."

A series of bizarre accidents occur, and Karen begins to suspect everyone of conspiring against her as she unravels the truth about her baby.","*** SPOILERS *** As with a wicked Tinkers-to-Evers-to-Chance double-play combination, in ""Omen IV"" we've gotten the evil seed of the late AntiChrist Damien Thorn back.

After being donated to the ""deserving"" couple of Yorkers Karen & Gene, Fay Grant and Michael Woods from the St. Francis orphanage of the Catholic Church. <br /> <br /> Little Delia wasted no time in feeling her peasants scratching her mother at a house party.

When Karen is pregnant again, she finally decides to find out the truth about the true parents of Delia. Then they and we in the audience face the truth. She is not only the dreaded Antichrist of Revelation, she is his twin sister! Her brother, the Anti-Christ himself, will appear as her little brother, the unborn son of Alexander York! <br /> <br /> Three times were more than enough for the AntiChrist to return to Earth to bring forth Armageddon. The movie that went public became a little tired of him and his evil adventures. It really was not necessary with a fourth since Daimten Thorn, the original Antichrist, had been dead and buried for years. They were brought by the usual tone of voice without anyone believing that Delia was ""Thee"" AntiChrist until it was almost too late to stop them in their lethal rounds of destruction of all humanity. The movie, which is so bad, is also far too long, 97 minutes, for a horror movie that could well have told its story is as little as 80 minutes. <br /> <br /> With a private eye Earl Knight, Mchael Lerner, and later a former Catholic nunner Yvonne, Megan Lehmich, and now faith healer Felichy in the movie, just to be killed, did not help the plot either. It only prolonged the suffering of those who saw the movie. They could almost see the surprising ending as soon as the movie ""Omen IV"" began with the bases finally free for the possible takeover of the civilized as well as uncivilized world of Delia. What was a surprise was that Delia did it with a little help from friends."

The central theme of a city plagued by a plague in modern times is intriguing, but the film never really explores or develops it. It's well done and entertaining, but it's not as interesting as it should have been. The script for this is really weak and brings down the whole movie. None of the main characters is really convincing or believable. <br /> <br /> Luckily the movie is very well done and compensates for the weak scripting. The director of Elia Kazan keeps the movie exciting and moves with lightning speed. There are some outstanding sequences, especially the memorable pursuit highlight. When his director was combined with better scripts several years later, the man usually could not go wrong. <br /> <br /> The acting is also very good. Richard Widmark has always been a handsome leading actor, doing what he can with a signed character. Paul Douglas spends his time roaring a bit too much, but he also does a decent job. The outstanding in the cast are the two villains. Zero Mostel, best known for his comic roles, is effectively slimy as one of cinema's ultimate toady characters. Jack Palance is, as you might expect, a vile villain. ""Panic in the streets"" is disappointing, but still worth seeing. (7/10)"

He then heads off to break through an impenetrable police and F.B.I. road-block.","Spoiler through: <br /> <br /> I'm really in the minority, but I liked this movie. It's not a classic, but it's definitely an adrenaline ride. I definitely thought it was worth at least a rating of 7. <br /> <br /> Maybe the reason why I liked it is because I did not see the original. Something tells me that with a movie like this one it will be the strongest fans, the people who have not seen the original version and have little to compare. It was not a masterpiece, but I spent a lot of time on it and it really got me to see the original. <br /> <br /> There were a few things I liked about it. One was the casting of Kowalkski. Viggo Mortenson was excellent and brought a lot of charisma to the role. Since most of the film fell on his shoulders, he really had to be excellent, and so was he. That was important to him. <br /> <br /> Another interesting thing about Vansishing Point was the fact that it was made for television. I had no idea that this was the case. It really did seem like a great movie and I never thought that this was not a big screen release. <br /> <br /> I also found the story very exciting. I'm not into action movies, but I got involved in them. Besides, it was much more than an action movie that had drama, mysticism, a love story, bizarre people, no matter how you turned. (I did not even recognize Priestly.) And it was touching. That was not a great movie, but it is worth seeing. <br /> <br /> And then there's an end. It's a big hit, and if you've been involved in the story so far, it's very difficult not to be fixated in the end. I'm not sure how I feel about the end. The implication was that Kowalkski survived and though I'm very skeptical about how that would be possible, it's a movie and realism is not an ingredient that's always in the mix when you make a movie. <br /> <br /> So I have to say that I found the ending incredibly unrealistic, but very touching in a manipulative way, which I do not usually like, but for some reason it's almost forgivable in this movie. Granted, many things were just props for the plot (could the rogues have been more stereotypes?) But the creators did a lot of right, even though they did a lot of things wrong. However, I will admit that I can understand why someone who is a big fan of the original would hate this version, because even though I did not see the original, I have seen many original films that have been re-made with terrible results. (My big dislike is actually sequels.) But I can understand the low ratings if the original is of that high quality. <br /> <br /> People compared that to Smoky and Bandit. How about a street version of ""Legends Of The Fall"" and ""Thelma And Louese""? I have touched the two films (which I both like very much). But I do not think that was a great movie. It was better than average, but not at all great. But it was a captivating, adrenaline-charged, touching film with excellent casting of the main character. My vote is 7 out of 10."

""The house that dripped blood"" consists of four wonderfully macabre tales, all in the same eerie mansion. These four stories are presented to you in a wonderful gothic atmosphere and with one of the best ensemble casts. Peter Cushing, Christopher Lee (Cushing and Lee are two of my favorite actors of all time), Denholm Elliott and the gorgeous Ingrid Pitt starring role in this movie - so what true horror fan could afford to miss him? Nobody, of course, and the movie has much more to offer than just a great cast. ""The house that dripped blood"" revolves around an eerie country house where strange things happen. In four parts, the film tells stories of four different heirs. <br /> <br /> The first story, ""Method For Murder"", tells the story of horror novelist Charles Hyller (Denholm Elliott), who moves in with his wife. After moving in, the writer suddenly feels struck by a maniac of his own creation ... The first segment is a great catalyst for the film. The story is scary and macabre and the performances are very good. <br /> <br /> In the second story, ""Waxworks"", the retired businessman Phillip Grayson (Peter Cushing) moves in and suddenly feels drawn to a mysterious wax museum in the nearby town ... The great Peter Cushing delivers here again a sublime performance, and the other performances are very good. The story is delightfully funny and the second best of the movie, after the third. <br /> <br /> The third story, ""Sweets To The Sweet"" is by far the scariest and most brilliant of the four. John Reed (Christopher Lee) moves in with his little daughter. Private tutor and Nanny Mrs. Norton, who has instructed Mr. Reed to teach his daughter, is appalled by her employer's strictness towards his daughter, and is eager to find out why the overprotective father's views could be upbringing ... This best segment retains a very spooky atmosphere and a really scary plot. Christopher Lee is as always superb in his role. Nyree Dawn Porter is also very good as a nanny, and my special praise goes to the then 11-year-old Chloe Franks. This ingenious segment makes the film a must for any true horror fan. <br /> <br /> In the fourth segment, horror actor Paul Henderson (Jon Pertwee) enters the house with his sexy mistress / co-star Carla (Ingrid Pitt). This fourth story is satire, more than it really is horror. However, it is a very amusing satire, and there are many allusions to other horror movies. At some point, Henderson indirectly refers to Christopher Lee, who plays in the previous, third segment ... <br /> <br /> All four segments have a wonderfully macabre sense of humor and a great atmosphere. As mentioned above, the third segment is by far the scariest and biggest, but the other three are also atmospheric and often macabre humorous horror stories that any horror lover should appreciate. An ingenious atmosphere, a macabre sense of humor, real eeriness and a brilliant cast make this a must. In short, ""the house that dripped blood"" is an excellent horror bus that no lover of British horror can afford. Highly recommended!"

Flash-forward to the present day, and an American family of three moves into this since-abandoned house and starts to experience incidents of haunting and possession.","I do not think anyone sitting down to watch this movie would expect something remotely like a classic ghost story, but you have to ask yourself when it's over, when you'll ever be afraid. That does not really work on that level, but the cast tries it a lot and the movie does not fade on one of those happy endings. The story is about an American couple traveling to Kyoto, Japan for Ted Fletcher (Edward Albert) to write a book and bringing his wife Laura (Susan George) and their daughter Amy (Amy Barrett). Her friend Alex Curtis (Doug McClure), who works at the American Consulate, helps them find a home and finds one who is being persecuted. About 140 years ago, a samurai found his wife in the same house who cheated on him and he killed them and then committed suicide. Their spirits still inhabit the house and when the Fletcher arrives, it does not take long before strange things happen. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> Sometimes the ghosts inhabit the bodies of the Fletchers and they begin to behave like the Japanese they do Laura and Laura start flirting with Alex, which leads to an affair. Meanwhile, Ted begins to act harder and after pouring soup into Amy's neck, he asks a monk for help. Unfortunately, the ghosts have got Ted, Laura and Alex to play their death scene as it happened 140 years ago. <br /> <br /> This movie was filmed by Kevin Connor, who is known as a good TV director, but he has done horror and science fiction films before and has worked with McClure on some of them. While this is never nearly as scary or evolving atmosphere, it has two things that I like. First, it does not have one of those juicy ends where the couple embrace after defeating the demons. Instead, it ends in a very bloody fight in which everyone succumbs to the evil of ghosts. Second, it has Susan George in the cast! I have always been a fan of her, even though she has performed mainly in Schlock, but her performances are always top notch. She also usually appears naked, which makes her here in two different scenes and while she has no classical traits, she has a unique tomboy-like look about her and it's one of the reasons she was so popular. But after appearing in silly movies like this one, I think that made her quit or work sporadically. This is not a bad movie, but it is never convincing and observing the ghosts when the monk gives an exorcism is practically worth one or two giggles. The bottom line is that this is silly and I hope that George decides to resume her career."

Josie, the young waitress becomes his target and the cop must find a way to rescue her and ultimately the entire human race which will become extinct if the mating occures.","Hi, I'm a friend of werewolf movies, and when I saw the title of Darkwolf coming on the shelves I was like ""hmm, simple and nice name at least ... Althou ... I wonder why I did not hear about it before. ""<br /> <br /> First of all, the movie starts with tits. Many tits. Tits are pretty much everything the movie budget costs. Who cares about a werewolf effect, simply pays the actresses enough to get up without shots! <br /> <br /> So, about the mysterious Darkwolf character (a few spoilers ahead, but who cares ...) He's your average cyclist every day. Not even super-tough, but as the old wise woman in the movie says ""he's a lot more powerful and dangerous than you've ever seen before."" Just by describing a tattooed biker guy of a guy. Pretty original. I even looked twice when they first used the ""red-hot eyes"" SPECIAL EFFECT! I mean, my God, since the seventies the effect ""lets-plant-red-dots-on-eyes-with-computer"" is used. It just looks ugly! And do not let me start with the werewolf 3D CGI. Like I said, like a bad and old video game. <br /> <br /> And finally, as I like werewolff movies, as I said. They always build their own werewolf legend. Darkwolf is also building the werewolf world, about some silly legends of hybrid werewolves and the old bloodline. BUT. It begins almost instantaneously after creating the rules of engagement ""the dark wolf kills everyone the girl has touched"" and begins with random strokes. Which just does not make sense, why tell us the rules of killing, if they do not even play by them ... Aplus the Wolfsblick settings are made with a Sony Handycam or something, mainly filming the floor and the walls. Just add growling noises and you have a super werewolf effect. The blood is partly okay. But if the wolf hits anyone with an open hand by simply putting his hand on the victims, that just is not the case for me ... Really, who gives you money? Do these piles of junk-to-video horror tracks, they're not even funny, bad movies, just sad."

This movie was so bad that I sat down and almost prayed that there would be a good minute movie time to justify the one and a half hours that were wasted. Needless to say, I was brutally disappointed. At a beach house, where a group of college friends celebrating vacation, this film suffers from numerous problems that make him not worth seeing. First, there are gaping plot holes. Second, very few of the C-list (I dare not call them B) actors can behave damn well, so any scenes that have potential fail miserably. Third, the speed of the film is very restless and awkward to watch most of the time, making tension very difficult, resulting in very few surprises for the audience. Fourth and most importantly, the ending is completely anti-climatic, partly because of how it ends (attitude / who is the killer) and partly because the dialogue is simply gruesome. To the movies credit, it's the only movie I'll ever say is the worst movie I've ever had, and I've seen a lot. <br /> <br /> So, just like a bad joke that you would have the happier it was never to be heard, the next time someone asks you if you want to know a secret, you're going to scream no, you really do not do it if you run in the opposite direction."

Home Alone 3 was not terrible, but probably it should not have been, you can not just replace Macauley Culkin, Joe Pesci or Daniel Stern.

You get what you pay for. It's a story of love, betrayal, lies, sex, scandal, anything you want in a movie. Definitely not a Hollywood blockbuster, but for cheap thrills it's not that bad. I would probably never see this movie again. In short, this is the kind of movie you see either very late at night on a local TV station that just wants to take some time, or you would see it on a local TV station on a Sunday afternoon, which is trying some time take advantage of. Despite the bad acting, cliché lines and sub-par camera work. I did not want to turn off the movie and pretend that it never fell into my DVD player. The story has often been made in many films.

Through the course of the night some will unravel, some will question, and all will fight for their lives as the house fights back.","Somewhere in his non-fiction book, DANSE MACABRE, Stephen King suggests that one of the secrets to writing scary stories is to avoid showing your readers exactly what a horrible thing is waiting to get behind the door. When the door finally springs open and a three-meter beetle hops through the door, the reader may be a little scared, but he'll also think, ""Well, I can handle that, at least it was not a hundred feet tall."" There's nothing More frightening than what lurks invisible and unknown, just on the other side of this tightly locked door, waiting to get you. <br /> <br /> THE HAUNTING is so completely wrong that director Jan De Bont is more or less misunderstood, begins his film by metaphorically opening the door himself and shouting, ""Look, everybody, look! ten-foot-tall beetle, is not that SCARY ?! "" The law of diminishing returns immediately. At the end of the film, the director jumps up and down, furiously beating his CGI pots and pans and shouting hoarsely: ""Look, everyone, look, ten hundred and fifty bugs! ... And now, here are a hundred and fifty bugs!"" The filmmakers evidently believed that special effects alone could compensate for all the other shortcomings in this effort (and there are many) .You can not and not. In fact, the special effects, as impressive as they are, are insistent and intrusive that the distracted viewer stares at her - whether in admiration or anger - rather than delving into a story. <br /> <br /> For me, the Nadir is the sheer stupidity of this movie, if a statue, with ""blood"" Out of his mouth, trying to drown Liam Neeson (as Dr. Marrow) in a well, the filmmakers clearly did not know what to do with this alleged idea once they got it, so they just have Neeson a bit Thrown around in the water, battered around with his arms and made lucky. In the next scene, the good doctor apparently dried himself and, ho hum, forgot all about the annoying incident. <br /> <br /> Shirley Jackson's novel seems to have been dumbed down by a committee in this ridiculous script of young low-IQ pugnacii who thought the way to scare people was to make every effect bigger and louder : ""Okay, next, let's, um, make the blanket, you know, look like a scary face and er, come down on her ... and all those spiky things, like, drop her in the bed."" <br /> <br /> The only salvation of THE HAUNTING is that it finally gets so horrible that it's actually funny. By the time Owen Wilson (as Luke Sanderson) fell to the ground and then walked on his Magic Carpet Ride O 'Death, I fell to the ground myself and laughed myself. <br /> <br /> Badly built, witless, grotesquely ponderous, absolutely incredible, and filled with chunky dialogues and pointless scenes, this empty HAUNTING is a textbook example of how not to make a horror movie."

I honestly believe it must have been 20 years since I last saw one. I remember that it was a seriously flawed movie. I can not remember that it is so bad !!!!! <br /> <br /> I am absolutely appalled that a project with so much potential must have been treated so badly. Who am I responsible for this? The 2 guys who wrote the script (and I use the word loose)? The casting directors who have made at least three main characters in the story so terribly wrong? (Only two of them are among the ""Fantastic 5"".) The director, who obviously did not take it seriously and repeatedly pushed bad writing and bad drama everywhere? (I liked the title song - but it should never have been used throughout the movie!) Don Black, who was supposed to be ASHAMED on some of the lyrics he wrote for this music? <br /> <br /> It is expected that I should get this out, less than a week after reading the comic adaptation again. The first 15-20 minutes of the film more or less (really, less) in parallel to the first issue of the comic. When I saw it tonight, I kept asking myself - why was almost every single detail changed? Doc appeared, then used the remote control of his watch to open the safe, and the sniper's bullet missed him by five inches because the refracting glass was the only thing that remained the same. I mean, if you make an ""adaptation,"" WHY CHANGE EVERYTHING in God's name ??? <br /> <br /> Once they've left Doc's headquarters, virtually nothing is the way it was in the comic book (which, given Roy Thomas, I guess, probably follows the book). I read somewhere that they combined elements of two different novels in one movie. Again - WHY? I heard that it was changed because they were unable to get the budget they wanted. I look at the movie and think ... LACK OF MONEY does not explain what I saw on screen! <br /> <br /> You know, when people complain about Joel Schumacher, they should really take a look at this thing. The best I can say is that the BATMAN feature from 1966 would make it a great dual feature - and probably a great triple calculation with the 1980's FLASH GORDON. All 3 films are ""silly"". Maybe we can ""blame"" the 1966 film (and television series) for that. Some fans have complained over the years that Adam West's BATMAN has ruined the image of comics in the minds of generations of non-comic fans. I think the same could be said for Hollywood. I remember how many really, really bad movies based on ""classic"" characters have been made over the years, especially (so it seems to me) in the late 70's and early 80's. Charlie Chan, Fu Manchu, Tarzan, Buck Rogers, Flash Gordon, The Lone Ranger - all ""murdered"" by Hollywood guys who think, ""Oh, comics, you know, it's supposed to be stupid!"" More like you are the ""stupid"". What a waste of potential. <br /> <br /> Let me say a few good things ... Despite the script and the direction, Ron Ely is GREAT. When I read a DOC SAVAGE story, I'm not thinking of the James Bama pictures, but of Ely. Bill Lucking (who was a regular member of The A-Team later) is terrific. Eldon Quick (whom I have seen elsewhere but can not remember) is terrific. Paul Gleason - whom I absolutely hated with passion and revenge at the BREAKFAST CLUB (""Teacher"" like the one he has played should not be taught anywhere) could be the best of the ""amazing 5"" in the movie. Pamela Hensley - although her part of the original story was almost unrecognizable - is terrific. Before she rolled her hair, I realized that she saw a HELL of a lot like ""Ardala Valmar"" from those awful John Calkins BUCK ROGERS streaks that I've just read. She has a big nose like Ardala - just not so pronounced. The comics Ardala actually looked more like the movie from 1936, Princess Aura- or Cher. Or maybe Streisand. Take your choice. (Ardala actually got a plastic surgery on the George Tuska strip - it was amazing after that!) <br /> <br /> Paul Wexler, funny enough, I just saw in a GET SMART episode last week. I wonder if he was something like the character he was supposed to play? I do not know, because this character was certainly not in the movie from which the film takes its title."

From the humble beginnings of preaching at his portable pulpit on New York City subways, to having a congregation of thousands - Bill Talen (aka Rev. Billy) has become the leader of not just a church, but a national movement.","This film is just another distortion, among many distortions, on the so-called ""sins of consumerism"".

Yes, America has more than its share of problems - but with perseverance Americans have always had great difficulties. And even in times of conflict, America has proved to be the largest country in the world. This happens when Americans contract and unite instead of separating and sharing. Yes, there are problems with companies and monopolies, but it will take Americans to bring back the small businesses, along with the ethics of taking care of the people in our individual communities. Yes, globalization has brought us its share of problems, but it will take Americans to bring production back to America. The Americans and the US government need to learn how to stick to a budget, no matter how big or small, and we need to stop our credit dependency. Our excessive reliance on credit will make us from cradle to grave and keep us poor. It is important to buy - but if we buy less, we will rely less on credit. And if we are able to save even a small amount of money, we will have money for a rainy day. Not to say that we as Americans will get an equal share of wealth. Wealth is not guaranteed and was never guaranteed. But stratification teaches us that only a small percentage of Americans own most of America's assets. There is a good closeness that you or I can reach the upper middle class level. And who knows what can happen from there?!? Be positive, work hard - and at least we can achieve at least some (if not all) of our dreams. Nothing is guaranteed in life, but we always have something to achieve. And if you or I have no dreams, we might as well be dead. In America there is always room for many hopes and dreams. As individuals, we are part of the pack, but we can always be the leader of the pack. <br /> <br /> It has always been my experience that churches and religion offer nothing more than additional bias, but I appreciate and respect people with different beliefs, values ​​and perspectives. But as far as the distortions are concerned, in this film I have no faith in such beliefs, values ​​and perspectives. I rate this film at 1 out of 10 - but in all honesty and truth, this film deserves a zero. This movie has no integrity, and I can not recommend it."

Her strongest memories are of the family's houseboy, Protee - a man of great nobility, intelligence and beauty - and the intricate nature of relationships in a racist society.","The film portrays France's unsolved problems with its colonial legacy in western (francophone) Africa through the confused and complex psychoanalytic prism of a young woman, France (symbolically representing her nation here). It is an often engaging and challenging portrait of the desire of a young woman to deal with a traumatic moment in her past, especially the desire of a nation to turn to the ""other"" that once possessed and shaped it. This is reflected in the way in which it is all about the notion of traveling (or transit) from the present to the past; reminded realities of undeniable contemporary political and economic news. <br /> <br /> The characters all play a symbolic, albeit limited and unconvincing role. France, which is supposed to be both a visual and a totemic representation of contemporary French society, leaves her position indifferent, as she still seems to be filled with the same naivety she enjoys as a child - in fact, as a child, she seems more attached to her his possession of their reality. The rest of the rag-tag ensemble is easy to forget. The Black Africans are at least insulting impressionist portraits of former colonized peoples rumored by the poor handling of their material.

They were poor, they were black, and they were living proof that if you have Jesus and your family, nothing is too difficult. Sure, James would lose jobs and JJ would fail at school, but the family always found a way. <br /> <br /> James was the strong male role model who earned the income and disciplined the children. Florida was the strong lady that every James had trapped when it took a shoulder to cry or hug to make it. The children had personalities and input that made them important as a family unit.

James worked so much that you could feel for him, but the others were not realistic at all, and that's a shame. <br /> <br /> JJ was the weird relief, but I felt the show needed substance.

I mean, here was a guy who failed at school, he was always fired and he painted about two episodes of money. James was always there to promote his talent, but Flo and the rest of the family did not seem to care. <br /> <br /> Why did it take him so long to understand that painting was what he meant? He could have sold paintings on the street or worked for people printing billboards and maps. (But he did something wrong.) Why did not he make it and why did the others give up their dreams? I'll tell you why, because they did not have a father in their life to care for and cheer them on, and their mother stopped being hers to support their dreams.

When the money is stolen, Rob is forced into a Robin Hood lifestyle to defend his family and honour.","This rousing drama has it all: first-rate acting, incredible photography, good story. It is often compared to ""Braveheart"" as both films are in historic Scotland. Although I love Braveheart, I think that this is the better of the two films. Jessica Lange gave an incredible performance (should be nominated for an Oscar). Liam Neeson is fantastic in the title role. Tim Roth plays one of the nastiest, most despicable characters in film history (he was nominated for an Academy Award). John Hurt is excellent as Lord Montrose, another unattractive character. I am always amazed at the incredible range of characters that John Hurt can play. This is a story about a dispute over money between Rob Roy and his clan and Lord Montrose. Rob Roy is a self-made man who will not solve his problems with Montrose if it violates his sense of honor. Montrose, who inherited his title, has no sense of honor. And that's what this story is about. Glory of the common man against corruption of the nobility. This movie is very entertaining, it should appeal to everyone. It has romance, action, beautiful scenery and has an exciting plot. One of my favorite movies."

What such films need are credible and likable characters, along with some semblance of reason in the actions. <br /> <br /> This movie is missing both.

The film stars Bruce Willis as James Cole, a prisoner of the state in the year 2035 who can earn parole if he agrees to travel back in time and thwart a devastating plague. The virus has wiped out most of the Earth's population and the remainder live underground because the air is poisonous. Returning to the year 1990, six years before the start of the plague, Cole is soon imprisoned in a psychiatric facility because his warnings sound like mad ravings. There he meets a scientist named Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) and Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), the mad son of an eminent virologist (Christopher Plummer). Cole is returned by the authorities to the year 2035, and finally ends up at his intended destination in 1996. He kidnaps Dr. Railly in order to enlist her help in his quest. Cole discovers graffiti by an apparent animal rights group called the Army ...","Most of all, we know that Bruce Willis is a good actor, but if you take the majority of his films, you'll see that the characters have those moments in which they're the same. His character in this film is far beyond any single so far ... and counts. The story begins in the (not so distant) future in which a man is sent back to the past to find the source of a virus that swept most of humanity from the face of the earth. The story seems to go in the direction of SF, but I think it's rather a drama because of the slow rhythm of the story. Movies tend to be faster and slower at some points and are more towards the end than at the beginning, but when you watch this movie, you will be aware of the constant rhythm of the story and reveal facts that neither accelerate nor slow it down. It's the same speed that flows gently and pretty well. But that does not mean the end will not irritate your nerves because it's pretty good. As far as the direction goes, it is prefect. Movies as such are easily destroyed by bad direction, but this has gotten a lot better. So, if you are preparing to see a sci-fi movie or action, you will miss it. B There should be more movies like this."

It does not work that way at all, so I do not understand why the media likes to continue that. There is not a single Russian bridal introduction website that works this way, and I challenge everyone to find one that does. The fact is that you can only order the CONTACT INFORMATION of the Russian lady (e-mail, address, phone number, etc.) from the website. From then on, you will correspond and visit them, and if you want to bring them to your country, start the immigration process in your INS office and wait months later.

Despite the fact that his friends don't believe him and desperate to help save the colony, Flik volunteers to go out into the world and search for a group of 'warrior' bugs. Instead, what he got was a talented group of circus performers. But when the grasshoppers return and take control of the island, Flik must prove himself a true hero before it's too late.","(originally a reaction to a movie critic who said A Bug's Life was too much, too fast - he was ""dazed and exhausted"" by the pictures and seemed to ignore the story altogether) <br /> <br /> Okay, first I am 26 years old, have a job, go to school and have a fiancé. So maybe I'm crazy and just really good at hiding it ... but I did not just get away from A Bug's Life exhausted or dizzy, it was not until I saw it for the second time that I really could start guessing the art and the humor of the spectacular pictures - because when I saw this movie for the first time, I was so engrossed in the story and the characters that I FORGET that I should be sitting there are visually ""enthusiastic"" of any frame , How can you not empathize with Flik and his life, which is paved from the road to the devil? ""Damn,"" I found myself identified with this little ant (not to mention a few other bugs) in more ways than one ... and that tells me more about what an incredible movie that is than a whole book about his nice eye candy. Of course it is beautiful (every blade of grass, the tree, the rain ...). Of course, what they can do with technology is amazing (you can read their lips, give it a try!). But this film is not just a masterpiece of art and technology, not just a dazzling explosion of movement and color. No, A Bug's Life would be static if that was not history. But I'm glad to say it is not! The life of a beetle has a real heart. Yes, there is a lot going on, both in the story and visually, but that's because the story and the characters actually have some depth! Just because it's a children's movie does not mean you have to turn off your brain at the theater door - children are smarter than you think! Besides, I think the PIXAR crew did that for themselves, even in front of their kids ... and that shows in the crowd in which the heart is. This film moves, touches, funny, intriguing and generally captivating. The character development in such an ensemble cast is amazing, there's a lot of character growth, not just the main character - so rare in animation and often in movies in general. It does not hit you over the head with its points once it's done - every scene, every frame has a purpose in the plot to be there, and there are no unnecessary shots. Not always saying exactly what is going on means subtlety to me, people; it does not mean ""dumbing down"" your movie and assuming that the audience is stupid, which it usually is not. All I can think is, if you see A Bug's Life and feel nothing at all, then you've never made a big mistake, hurt your friends, fell in love, was in love, was frustrated that no one would listen. You lied to someone who loved you important, feel like a social outsider, look forward to a new idea, come up with a great idea, had a great idea, were embarrassed, and in the next moment were sure of the pressure of responsibility, standing for yourself and your loved ones stood up against the crowd, felt like a failure, felt like a great success, felt the need to make a difference with your life in the lives of others ... well, you get the point. Closing words: A + rating from me; please, if you want to see it, try the movie (pan and scan video will NOT work for this movie); If you love Toy Story, you probably will love it (PIXAR knows how to make heart-shaped films); If you love it, you will see it several times, or you may still not know what you miss (the amount of detail and subtlety here is considerable); and if you really feel deep, pretend it's a seed, okay?"

Later, he signs on for a sealing voyage, tries Yukon prospecting and a brief university career, loving and leaving women along the way. Instead of riches, he gets story ideas. Suddenly, he finds success and a delectable lady; but the urge to adventure won't let him go.","In his short 40 years on earth, author Jack London managed to make as many adventures and incidents as he could. This 90-minute film, supposedly a biography of man's life, but obviously fictionalized, does not even scratch the surface and remains a story ripe for a modern retelling. Here Michael O'Shea portrays London in one of his first roles, and his performance is both rough and likable. He is not the problem here. Nor is it a young and very beautiful Susan Hayward, who plays his future wife Charmian, whose biography about London forms the ""basis"" for this film. London's life has been broken down into a series of episodes that the film easily skips. So we have brief incidents with London as an oyster pirate, Sealer in the Bering Sea, Gold Prospector in the Yukon and correspondent during the Russo-Japanese War ... certainly colorful events, but hardly anything like deep treatment. And Alfred Santell's direction (he shot one of Susan's first films in 1939, ""Our Leading Citizen"") is capricious at best. Somewhat harder is a DVD of very poor quality with a cheesy-looking pressure source and a hissing sound. Perhaps the best thing about this movie rental for me was one of the extras of the DVD: a catalog of all alpha video films with hundreds of full-color movie posters. Hopefully these movies are better than ""Jack London""!"

The story of 7EVENTY 5IVE, on the other hand, is that of a horror movie that had a little bit of promise, unfortunately overcompensated by really bad writing. <br /> <br /> What could have been fun, albeit a silly, old-fashioned Slasher story, is derailed early on by the misleading beliefs of the filmmakers that the audience would enjoy listening to a bunch of louder, whiny children watching, who scolded each other most of the time. With the exception of a police detective, played by Rutger Hauer (in a minor role mainly focused on adding the film's only star power), every character on the screen is a different kind of young A-hole. <br /> <br /> Male and female, black and white, straight and gay, a whole ensemble of superficial and shrill college kids carries most of the film's narrative. Worse, since the story is about a failed PARTY game, the scenes are usually full of these little b ***** ds. For this reason, there are few interruptions for the viewer, who has to resign himself to the angry sharp shooting of the thinly drawn protagonists. Although at least some of these people are supposed to be friends, all the characters interact in a very hostile way, long before any real conflict has actually arisen. This leads to the worst possible outcome in a Slasher movie: The audience, who should take care of the leads, cheers not only to the anonymous murderer, but wishes that he has started picking up the stinking brats much earlier. > <br /> The real disgrace of this bad characterization is that otherwise 7EVENTY 5IVE actually had a potential. Visually, it is fine. The first directors Brian Hooks and Deon Taylor know how to build an exciting atmosphere. They also manage to deliver some competent, albeit sparse, moments of the classic '80s style. Surprisingly, the occupation of the production is quite capable. It's not that the actors are unable to express realistic human emotions; It's just that the script (along with newcomer Vashon Nutt and director Hooks, who ran much better behind the camera than with a keyboard) does not have such moments. <br /> <br /> 7EVENTY 5IVE can hardly be recommended as its familiar premise and thrill do not outweigh the bad taste left behind by a story driven by a bevy of disagreeable characters.

Shemp's scene is poisoned and her reaction is really great.

They are all persecuted by a crazy Vietnam veteran and brutally murdered. ""Trampa Infernal"" is a pretty entertaining Mexican slasher who reminds me a lot of ""The Zero Boys"". The movie is fast paced and there are some good death scenes like throat cutting or ax in the neck. Unfortunately, there is not much blood left, so fans of Grand Guignol will be disappointed. However, if you are a fan of Slasher movies, give this rarity a look. Mexican horror movies are pretty obscure (I only have ""Alucarda"" and ""Do not Panic"" seen), so this should be another reason to see this pleasurable Slasher.

Faith herself quickly returns Ahab's love, as Derek is drab and ignoble. On his next voyage, however, Ahab loses a leg to the monstrous white whale Moby-Dick. When upon his return to New Bedford he mistakenly believes Faith wants nothing to do with him because of his disfigurement, Ahab returns to sea with only one goal in mind -- to find and kill the great white whale.","I suppose that any novel more stupid than Moby Dick would not be much of a favor to the onlookers of depression, who had had enough of their own problems. But any resemblance to the classic Herman Melville novel is a sheer coincidence. <br /> <br /> In fact, half of the movie is a prelude to the main story as we know it, not that too much of it was kept for the movie. We first meet Ahab Creely (he has a surname and a brother) as a happy, happy soul with two legs and the intention to marry Joan Bennett, the daughter of Father Mapple. This brother Derek, played by Lloyd Hughes, also wants to marry Bennett. <br /> <br /> John Barrymore is Ahab in an exaggerated performance. Barrymore had not quite mastered the sound cinema yet, and he gave up on all the silent film era and a stage voice that shook the rafters of every movie theater in which this movie was played. <br /> <br /> We see Ahab lose his leg to the big whale Moby Dick and I have to say the amputation scene was pretty cruel. Of course, that was all before the code. But I'm sure 1930 shook audience. <br /> <br /> After that the story of Ahab hunt for the whale he thinks made him look unsightly in Joan Bennett's eyes. This is not exactly Melville's motivation, in fact, there are no female characters in Moby Dick as he wrote it. <br /> <br /> One of the things Melville did was personalize the crew of Ahab's ship Pequod. Unlike Queequeg, the cannibal harpooner, the names are there, but not the personalities. Starbuck and Stubbs might as well be Smith and Jones. <br /> <br /> I would just watch this version of Moby Dick out of curiosity and nothing else."

And yes, he has been clapping too long with suspects, and the newly minted chief (Karl Malden, in a typically robust and challenging outing) warns him ""for the last time"". <br /> <br /> But Dixon hates these clubs too much to stop now. And boy, did not they let it come? <br /> <br /> ""Hoods, Dusters, Cups, Gutter Nickel Rat,"" he spits out as a boss's teaser refuses him and clears up all the discomfort the office has gotten over Dixon's right hook. The advice is that he cools down to his best.

Like Bogart in ""Lonely Place,"" can he ""escape what he is?"" <br /> When he has nowhere else to go, he discovers that he has virtually lost his unexpected relationship with a seraphic beauty (the wonderful Gene Tierney) who looks like she can make something of his barren bachelor life that it does is worth to come home too. <br /> <br /> The pace of this great movie is tense and thrilling. The group of authors who contributed to the production has polished the script to a high gloss - the dialogue is snappy, without falling into obsolete parody food, passionate, without becoming melodramatic or cheesy. <br /> <br /> And all of this first-rate direction and acting is not too smooth or polished to ease the movie's emotional hold. Gene Tierney's angel, soft focus beauty is used with great effect. She turns out to be an actress of considerable size, and her gentle, friendly nature is as limitless here as her psychosis in Leave Her to Heaven. The scenes between Tierney and Andrews Dixon become more intense and touching as he approaches self-destruction. <br /> <br /> Just before the end of his rope, cut, smashed and exhausted, Dixon sums up his fate: ""Innocent people can also end up in terrible jams ..."" he says. ""One wrong move and you're over your head."" <br /> <br /> Perhaps it's so overwhelming that this movie gives the impression that things could go crazy for just about anyone - especially someone who tries so hard to get it right - with a slight shift in the world Wind a wrong decision or a blow, or, most frightening, due to factors that you have no control over. Noir has always reflected the darkest fears, brought them to the surface. ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" makes that realistic. <br /> <br /> (A nitpick from one side: This otherwise stereotypical film has a terrificly bad copy of a blonde model that does not seem out of place at the Mystery Science Theater.)

With this statement, my own opinion about the movie is pretty low. I'm a fan of Takashi Miike, but that falls into the category of his not so great work together with DOA 2 and 3 and a few others (many). <br /> <br /> The movie seems to be getting free pass because it's a Takashi movie and nothing that can make Takashi wrong. This is a high school approach to the cinema. For the rest of us, we'll find one and a half hours of a kid screaming for no real reason (and yes, that removes the movie), the tempo of the movie almost reaches the level of Rigomortis, and doing ... well ... Hmmm. <br /> <br /> If you are a Takashi fan, you will see it, no matter in order to fulfill your interests. It lacks any originality (see the infinite story) or any character development of the main character in the face of a conflict that is not superficial. <br /> <br /> It should be noted that this is the first movie attributed to Miike Co-Writing, but that does not mean much that we would not hope that Miike's personality would be overflowing the screen. All we get are some of the token Miike shots against the cameraman. <br /> <br /> The movie had the potential to be something great. The premise is not difficult to feral. But he seemed to have run into the ground. <br /> <br /> My suggestion is that if you're just going to Miike, you're going through some of the standards like Gozu, Ichi and Audition. Then film in his works like Blue Harp, Fudoh, Rainy Dog, Bird People of China."

The only way to get it published is for Woods himself to illegally escape the country.","I saw this movie for the first time in 1987 when it was released and was very emotionally affected by a combination of guilt over what my white fellow human beings could do with innocent people and the reluctance of the outside world to really investigate these atrocities against humans Particularly moving was the funeral of Steve Biko, even more livelier and more punchy due to the at the time played South African anthem. For a long time, I believed that this film achieved what no one else has managed to do - to open the eyes of the world to what is really happening in South Africa. I consider myself a normal, right-thinking person and I can confirm that this film has changed my mindset not only about South Africa, but also how we perceive black people as white people. I've never seen a difference between people of any color or creed, but after watching this movie, I've changed my life and spent the last 17 years in a predominantly black country, helping many people to go beyond their current living standards they would not have thought possible. I've received the biggest reward I can honestly say - to say that in my own little way, I've improved my balance a bit. But with more people like me thinking and actually doing something to help black people without seeking rewards, the entire black population of this planet would be a little better off. <br /> <br /> I challenge every right-thinking person to watch Cry freedom from beginning to end and feel no emotion in your feelings as you testify how the 700 school children in Sharpville were brutally shot for refusing Learning Afrikaans, the pointless killing of Steve Biko, such a champion for the rights of his own people, and then, ultimately, to understand that all this is not just a movie, albeit a great movie, but that everything actually happens is and less than 30 years ago. <br /> <br /> Yes, my friends, watch this movie and then watch if you can go out and party hard. I could not. I was too angry to know the truth. This is the hallmark of a great movie. It was obviously the intention of Sir Richard Attenborough to spread this message about South Africa.

In fantasy films, elves are usually depicted with white skin and blond hair, while goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair. Anyone familiar with Frazettas, Bakshi or even Tolkien's work knows that they are not racist. Anyone who likes fantasy movies should like this movie.

At that time, I was a healthy 20-year-old who loved movies and really liked Raquel Welsh. In addition, I had read the novel by Gore Vidal, on which he was based, and found it very funny. I saw the movie on a local drive-in and about halfway I was very tempted to turn on the engine of my car, so I might die from carbon monoxide poisoning and not have to see the rest of this shipwreck of a movie. It was not ""smart"" or ""trendy"", it was rude and sloppy. All the actors were flat and the director did not have the slightest idea what he was doing. The casting of Mae West was one of the worst decisions in film history. As a reviewer said, her role had nothing to do with the movie or the book. Her character in the book is sexually beaten by the young stallion, which would never do any good for the legendary Ms. West. Oh no, the plot has changed so that she beats him sexually, believably by a 77-year-old woman who looks every day of her age. I could go on, but why? It was a terrible movie. <br /> <br /> Bluto"

At the end of the worst day of his life, Bruce angrily ridicules and rages against God and God responds. God appears in human form and, endowing Bruce with divine powers, challenges Bruce to take on the big job to see if he can do it any better.","When I read the summary of the movie, what happens when a man gains the power of a god, and later learns that supernatural powers require great responsibility and strength, I thought that was a clever and original concept. Casting was also promising, Carrey, Freeman, Aniston ... How can film be bad with a good idea and good actors, not to mention film costs? It can. The idea is good, but the script and the story itself are awful. To be honest, Bruce Nolan is a rather mediocre journalist, with not exactly great stories (like a story about a giant cookie, what a faux pas, and the Niagara report is a total fiasco!), He's a man with a job he has completely EARTHED (he is not a good journalist, he is a comedian), given his potential, with a nice home, sugar sweet girlfriend and OH HORROR !!!! Dog who is not trained in the house !!! Yes, as soon as Bruce GOd at the beginning of the film in a ""God, why do you hate me!"" So the average viewer has to think, ""Why, what's wrong with your life, Bruce?"". Bruce is not, and definitely NOT the man with real problems in life. Most of the difficulties he encounters are minor and not really worth all the fuss he makes, and some of them are really just the result of his stupidity. Most people have really big problems, worth attention, most people are worth more attention, that Bruce, who finally does not seem too human, does not even look realistic, too stupid and neurotic, but God still talks to him. Why? Although Morgan Freeman looks nice as a god, I can not help wondering what he's doing in this particularly bad movie. And what does Bruce do when God gives him his powers? God in this film could easily give his powers to a 5-year-old child and there would be little difference. No, wait, a clever child would probably use his goddess better than Bruce. What is Bruce doing? Pull the moon closer to the earth to create a romantic atmosphere, share the red soup, lift a pretty woman's dress on the street, answer prayers by email and make them all true !!!! Not anymore, Bruce, please! What Bruce did could actually end the world, but in the movie that does not happen, because that's ""nice, family, little movie"" and makes no sense at all !!! No trace of sarcasm, of real humor, of jokes, of any dirty humor, at least !!! Nothing. Just Carrey plays silly, which looks pathetic to middle-aged actors. Aniston is understated here. She plays a pale, undeveloped character of Bruce's girlfriend Grace and remains completely forgotten in this movie. No one with the right opinion would believe that these two have any chemistry between them. When Grace speaks the prayer for Bruce, it sounds not only lame and pathetic, but completely wrong. These two are not meant to be together. I would give three stars, but I doubt that movie deserves one. Bad script, lame dialogues, lack of real humor, wit and sophistication, as well as undeveloped characters and understated Freeman's and Aniston's roles, total lack of courage and sarcasm, all makes movie barely worth ***. But OK, there were some funny moments, and Freeman is always nice to see in every movie, so we leave three stars."

In China, workers gather outside the factory, exhorted by their team leader to produce more and make fewer errors. A woman assembles a circuit breaker, and women and children are seen picking through debris or playing in it. Burtynsky concludes with a visit to Shanghai, the world's fastest growing city, where wealth and poverty, high-rises and old neighborhoods are side by side.","Edward Burtynsky is a Canadian photographer who makes art out of the few ""artful"" objects. Everyday items, such as boxes, boxes, metal containers, etc., which most of us at best perceive as utilitarian and dismiss as utterly aesthetically objectionable, are instead transformed into glorious works of art by Burtynsky's camera. He achieves this result by focusing on the recurring colors and geometrical patterns that seem to be ever present in the industrialized world - for those who see them perceiving enough to recognize them. Even heaps of compressed garbage can become objects of beauty through Burtynsky's lens (but did not we already know about Wall-E?). He is especially interested in photographing areas like mines and shipyards where man has already invaded nature - which might explain why sometimes even people in his paintings (ie the workers in those places) become uniformed and robotic Part of the industrial landscape. <br /> <br /> ""Manufactured Landscapes,"" a documentary on Burtynsky's work, has much of the feel of a ""Koyaanisqatsi"" because it astounds us with its colorful kaleidoscope of images and patterns. Director Jennifer Baichwal and cameraman Peter Mettler capture the essence of the original photos purely cinematographically, because Burtynsky and his assistant photograph a camera in a factory in China, a shipyard in Bangladesh and the construction site in the massive Three Rivers Gorge Damprojekt in China. With their fluid camera work, the filmmakers hit the beauty of Burtynsky's paintings point by point. In fact, the film begins with a stunning eight-minute camera shot of a Chinese factory, where hundreds of similarly dressed workers toil in perfectly symmetrical and color-coordinated rows. <br /> <br /> The film does less Well now that Burtynsky articulates the ""themes"" of his work that, frankly, sound confusing, contradictory and decidedly only half-baked. But it is a purely aesthetic experience that emphasizes image and form that ""Manufactured Landscapes"" matters most. In the case of Burtynsky, perhaps a picture is worth a thousand words."

It is very hard to imagine how a script of this repulsive sexist could be written without the intention of self-parody. And the issues repeatedly expressed by the female lead, Ginny Leith - a detached mind kept alive by machines, I-Vs and braces - seem to confirm that the film should exploit and criticize gender stereotypes simultaneously. Shades of undervalued Boxing Helena. <br /> <br /> The genderisms are numerous and as irritating as an army of angry ants. The dialogue is hyperbolic, overdramatic and unbelievable, and action is only OK (but not consistent). Why did I give this movie a 4? Because some thoughts have gone in clearly. I'm really not sure which point the movie actually wanted to do, but it seems clear that it's aiming for an uncommonly edgy and raw horror (without the blood and guts that today's audiences expect). <br /> <br /> Another unique and interesting aspect of the brain is that there are really no heroes in this movie and none of the characters is particularly personable. All in all, this is a rather painful and disturbing look at early 1960s American pop sexuality, from the perspective of a woman who, despite her missing body, was kept alive after a fatal car crash. Her lover threatens to sew a fresh, high-quality body to her and force her to continue living with him. She is understandably not permeated by all this and forced to befriend a creature almost as monstrous as her friend. Oh, there are some vague references to the cliché of the 1950s / 60s about the evil of amok, which is operated by science. <br /> <br /> Recommended for B-science fiction fans and doctoral students in gender studies. O / W not recommended."

On the way of the meeting, he confesses that they had traveled from Houston to New York to satisfy the wish of the reckless Kyle, who is his best friend since their childhood, of eating a sandwich from club 21 and the meeting was just a pretext to Kyle's father Jasper Hadley. Mitch and Kyle immediately fall in love for Lucy, and Kyle unsuccessfully uses his money to impress Lucy; then he opens his heart and proposes Lucy. They get married and travel to Acapulco and the insecure Kyle stops drinking. Meanwhile, Kyle's sister Marylee is an easy woman and has a non-corresponded crush on Mitch that sees her as a sister. One year later, Kyle discovers that he has a problem and might be sterile and starts drinking again. The ...","WRITTEN ON THE WIND, directed by Douglas Sirk and released in 1956, is, like all of Sirk's films in the '50s, pure melodrama. Yet it is a captivating, richly-developed melodrama, and Sirk's trademark, colorful expressionism, throbbing, barely repressed emotions, symbolism, and juxtaposition of classes make this film a desirable movie. <br /> <br /> The film opens brilliantly, with the four central characters and the plot being introduced as the credits are still rolling. Sirk uses a clever flashback to bring us into his world ... Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are great as the two Hadley ""Kids"", Kyle and Marylee. He drinks and sleeps with women. She drinks and sleeps with men. Both are worth millions thanks to the Hadley oil business. Hunky but poor, Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is Kyle's lifelong friend and Marylee's dream friend. Enter this dirty mess Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall), a slender, attractive young woman who falls under Kyle's charm after taking a phone and flying over the landscape one evening. Mitch loves her too, but Kyle wins her. They marry quickly and Kyle stops drinking. But fate seems to be in the wind, and it does not take long for a sneaky Marylee (who will have ""Mitch"", marriage or no marriage), a stealthy Mitch, the bewildered Lucy and the sad drunken Kyle to the ground go. ... <br /> <br /> Malone is just as wonderful as Marylee Hadley and deserves her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. She steals every scene she's in. Stack is almost as good, amplifying the melodrama, while still maintaining subtle and quiet desperation. Hudson and Bacall are much more restrained than these two, but it's consistent with the characters they play. <br /> <br /> So, what is all the melodrama really about? Well, many things. Stack's powerful portrait of male inadequacy and anxiety, on the one hand. Sirk surrounds Stack with phallic symbols throughout the movie - note his tiny little weapon, the oil derricks and the ultimate phallic symbol, Kyle's apparent inability to father children. Stack seems to be suffering from a massive male superiority complex compounded by his father's preference for Hudson, his sister's desire for Hudson, and his suspicion that his wife continues with Hudson. With all the wealth, Kyle Hadley still lands at the wrong end of town and buys cheap corn liqueur like a ""bum."" <br /> <br /> It's about impossible dreams and letting go of them. The river where Kyle, Marylee and Mitch played when they were children is constantly mentioned throughout the movie, symbolizing Kyle and (above all) Marylee's desire for the innocence and simplicity of youth. In an excellent melodramatic scene, perfectly supported by Malone, Marylee stands by the river and introduces herself as a child, with a voice-over from Mitch telling Marylee that she will always be his girl. Here Sirk meets a big emotional accent in the viewer. Who did not dream of returning to this special place in childhood? Who has not lived on a precious memory before? Who did not want something? And Hudson's last line of the movie (yes, he gets no dialogue in the last 10 minutes, just close-ups) remembers how far ""we came from the river, Marylee."" Amazing."

Such works warn us of undesirable trends in our society that we should be aware of; but to be effective, they also have to be entertaining. Unfortunately, most books are probably more effective in publishing the warnings than entertaining us enough to be read widely; While with the films the problem is usually reversed. The first such work, which became well known, was probably George Orwell's ""1984"" (first published in 1948), and this is still readily available, both in the form of a book and a film. <br /> <br /> Watch or read it: And if you feel a little depressed by man's inhumanity towards humans, grab Cinderella 2000. This is a featherweight, low-budget movie comedy that takes place on the same topic based and effortless but inappropriate viewing offers; and as with 1984, the calendar has now gone beyond its former period. Most of the comedy is done with a trowel, though there are only a few really funny moments. To train your mind in the long intervals in between, you can focus it on the question of whether this film will get a new extension of life by being released as a DVD or forgotten, as existing tape copies will be copied after that Redemption will worsen. There are many worse movies these days that appear as DVD's, and frankly I do not care what happens in both directions. <br /> <br /> So far, the best of the films in this genre has been ""The Handmaiden's Tale,"" but I'd love to trade it for a well-made film of Jack London's soaring novel, ""The Iron Heel.""

Although this is definitely a mockumentar in the line of This is Spinal Tap, the makers have also realized that they do not want to play copycats. However, it roughly fails the jokes because it's not very well written and most of the characters are underdeveloped.

In one scene, the black preacher left behind when Buck was asked what ""dan7"" meant in computer graphics said, ""Daniel 7, * CHAPTER * 24."" He probably meant VERSE 24, but the filmmakers missed this slip-up. Perhaps the worst part is that the film's eschatological position is not biblically correct. While many Christians have advocated the interpretation of end-time events from the film, such an interpretation is flawed in my opinion.

When the astronauts were on the moon, they returned LOT of pounds of rock from the moon - for geological studies. These spread around the world in hundreds of labs testing them. And they all came to the conclusion that they came from the same planet, not from Earth: because the inner isotopes of the primitives are different from those on Earth, but similar to those calculated on the Moon. I.U. the conspiracy theorists never study anything: they only take what fits their theory and ignore the rest. <br /> <br /> Another wrongful claim is that their wind was in the hangar where they shot the moon landing, IE The flag is moving. There is a logical explanation: The astronaut moved it with his hand, so he moved. And what does that prove? Well, if the conspiracy theorists were to study the footage at all, they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut has allowed it, I.E. the conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they can not study a subject properly or just study it until they have what they have so that they can lie about it and profit (IE this so-called ""documentary"")). <br /> <br /> There is an assertion that it was not possible to be filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different sources of light, the artificial lighting from the studio.

This is a sore point for me, since I have long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to irritate and misuse scientific concepts and ideas, eg: Emmy Coer: ""Information waves have a half-life"", Ada: ""I am mine Not at all sure that half a life is better than no life at all.

Intertitles in the original Gothic script German with simultaneous English translation, accurate without being too literal. Live piano accompaniment. Ideal. <br /> <br /> The magic of the movie spewed for a while, but in the end I did not manage to catch it. <br /> <br /> This film has no real relationship to Wagner's ring cycle, as I already knew, but some did not. Wagner had adapted the 13th century. Niebelungenlied for his own purposes. The first part of Fritz Lang's epic - ""Siegfried"" - has a lot, but the listeners of Wagner will be familiar. <br /> <br /> ""Kriemhild's Revenge"" is the story of Siegfried's wife Kriemhild, her marriage to King Etzel (Attila) the Huns, and her desire for revenge against Hagen and Gunther, the renamed Nibelung, for the murder of Siegfried , The spectacular conflagration in this film probably developed and expanded in the Wagnerian myth to its Götterdämmerung, its Götterdämmerung and the end of Walhalla. This movie remains earthbound. <br /> <br /> Most of the movie is spectacular. The massive movements compete with those of ""Cabiria"" (1914), which inspired Griffith's ""Intolerance"" (1916). Their decoration sets a new standard in barbarian splendor. There is a huge cast of scarred, mangy huns and Art Deco burgundies. And fights. Battles that never really end. <br /> <br /> Kriemhild is very successful in her plan of revenge. She manages to destroy everything around her. Her loyalty to her martyr Siegfried seems not so much due to love or devotion, but to something closer to psychosis. Lady Macbeth exclaimed, ""Unsex me here."" She knew that she was not emotionally prepared for what she had to do. But Kriemhild does not show normal human emotions, and certainly nothing is female. She is already ""of the highest cruelty"" to use Shakespeare's Theorem from the beginning. Margarethe Schön and her director convey this with a scowl. I do not want to exaggerate, but this scowl is practically the only expression that ""animates"" Kriemhild's face. It's the ultimate in one-touch performances. However, it is clearly intended, not just a case of bad behavior. <br /> <br /> What we offer then is a one-dimensional sketch of a revenge revenge. Some see Kriemhild as an authorized heroine.

But it is still pretty well executed, and the story and above all the dialogue are interesting. They pretty much took the dialogue as it is from the actual game. Maybe it's a good introduction to Shaw's pieces. <br /> <br /> The main character Raina has her head in the clouds and a sense of drama, and Helena Bonham Carter's acting does a good job here.

One afternoon, while bathing in a lake, her horse escapes with her clothes and a young worker takes her back and gives her back to Eva. They fall in love and become lovers. Later, her husband misses her and tries to bring Eva home. Eve refuses, and luck leads the trio to the same place and tragically ends the affair. I've just seen ""Extase"" for the first time, and the first comment I've got relates to the awful quality of the VHS released by the Brazilian distributor Video Network in Brazil: The movie has only 75 minutes to go and it seems so Different rolls of film were used. Some parts are completely damaged and other parts are very damaged. Therefore, the beauty of the images is not achieved by the Brazilian viewer, if he has the chance to find these rare VHS in a rental or for sale. The film is practically a silent movie, the story is very outdated and has only a few lines. As a result, the characters are poorly developed. However, this film is also very daring, with the exposure of Hedy Lamarr beautiful breasts and nude body for today's state of beauty. Another fantastic point is the poetic and metaphorical use of flowers symbolizing the intercourse between Eve and her lover. The way the director shows the scenes to show the needs and deprivations of Eve is very clear. The inconclusive ending is also very unusual for a 1933 film. I liked this movie, but I hope one day I can see an 87-minute restored version. My voice is eight. <br /> <br /> Title (Brazil): ""xtase"" (""Ecstasy"")"

When I played it for a few hours, I realized how much fun it is! and how different than ""Max Payne"", yes the ball-time is a bit similar, but I think it's different to the game style. This game is non-stop action - a mix of a shoot'em up and a fight, so much fun, as a big fan of Max Payne I have to say that the story of DTR is not nearly the size of Max Payne, the graphics are a bit average and some of the levels look the same, but if you want a bit more of this ""ball time"", you should definitely own this game."

It may not have the funding and advertising that the latest Hollywood blockbusters get, but it contains twice the emotional punch. The story revolves around this one Utah family, and it's the connections between the people in the family who make their mark on the film. The main character (Giovanni Ribisi) plays his role very well, at no time does he make you believe that he plays all his emotions. It's his brother (Elias Koteas) who stole the show for me.

Meanwhile the deceased Joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of London. He cheats the Reaper and appears to the American student of journalism Sondra Pransky, who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician Sidney Waterman in London, and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat Peter Lyman. Sondra drags Sid in her investigation, seeking for evidences that Peter is the killer. However, she falls in love with him and questions if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop.","They're not lamenting journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell of ""His Girl Friday"" or witty detective William Powell and cheeky lady Myrna Loy of Thin Man, but Woody Allen and Scarlett Johansson are surprisingly charming as amateur snoopers in Scoop. Her republican screwball is postmodern rather than post-post-depressive, Allen's writings full of ironic self-irony and ordinary New York anxiety. Shades of the old joke are rare, as if he answers as Sid, the great Splendini magician, about his background: ""I was born into the Hebrew belief, but when I got older, I converted to narcissism."" Johansson, fresh from Allen's Match Point as a bad girl, is here a relatively good, sometimes thick journalism student, trapped in a murder mystery suitable for London: a serial killer. The storyline is a reworking of his recently released thriller Match Point in London, right up to the sins of the upper class and the accident with the ""American Tragedy"" / ""Place in the Sun"" boating. In fact, Allen is reviewing Manhattan Murder Mystery and Purple Rose of Cairo, to name just a few other examples. I do not care if he reworks; I would like the new material to be at least equal to the originals, and unfortunately it only reflects its younger size. <br /> <br /> Allen as a director and actor can not hide his love for the actress, as he could not for Diane Keaton, and therefore takes a mediocre comedy to an appropriate location in the Allen canon, not big but amusing , sometimes brilliantly satirical: About the alleged upper-class murderer Sid (Allen) jokes ""I would be very surprised if he had killed a person."" This is Vintage Allen humor. Although there are hardly any literary allusions, as in most films, he smears Scoop with music by Grieg, Tchaikovsky and Strauss to tell us that the Woodman has not lost his class."

He then injects this fluid into his wife.","Now I love Bela Lugosi, do not get me wrong, he's one of the most interesting people ever to make a movie, but he certainly made his share of clunkers. That's just another one of those. <br /> <br /> Lugosi plays Dr. Lorenz, a doctor who has inexplicably received his medical license. He does experiments, however, to keep his wife young and beautiful. It is known that she is 70-80 years old, but Lugosi seems to be in him in his mid 50s, so why he is married to this old woman is never really explained. Anyway, these treatments or experiments involved brides who are at the altar marrying some sort of sweet-smelling substance, but they pass out suspect that they are dead. Then Lugosi and some of his assistants steal the body on the way to the morgue and take it back to his lab, where it is kept in a kind of interrupted animation or catatonic state. Then a needle is rammed into the stolen brides Somewhere in their bodies, maybe the neck, and then the needle is rammed into the body of Lugosis's wife to bring her back to youth and beauty. We never really see where Lugosi's the needle sticks or what he pulls out of the brides, but it somehow restores his wife. Obviously, age makes you scream with pain because Lugosi's wife makes a lot of screaming until she returns to her younger state. Helping Lugosi in his lab is the only good thing about this film ... a weird old witch and her two deformed sons ... a son is a big lumpy-looking slow-acting guy who wants to caress the slumbering brides and the other son is a mean little dwarf ... little human to be politically correct in today's world. At night, these three just pile up and sleep in Lugosis monotony down in the lab. Who these 3 are and how they became Lugo's frightened assistants, as much in this film, is never explained. <br /> <br /> This is how a reporter is hired by her rogue editor to find out where all the stolen brides go to The only common ground among all the stolen brides is a rare orchid found on them. So she asks and learns that there is a world famous orchid expert who lives nearby and happens to be the one who developed this particular orchid. This expert turns out to be a scary Dr. Lorenz. She pursues him quickly and disturbs his little horror house. I'm not sure where the police were, but they came in to mop up after the reporter did everything Dirty work. <br /> <br /> It seems that Lugose's films always had some kind of unnecessary silly storyline that stinked the whole thing to a high sky. I mean, a world-famous orchid expert kidnaps brides by sending them a drug it is known that he himself has developed orchid? D'OH! <br /> <br /> And then it is revealed later that the young women do not even have to be brides to work, so why should Lugosi continue to kidnap brides from heavily guarded churches for his experiments and create all the attention and headlines? Why not just pick a prostitute off the street like a normal spinner would? This clunker reminded me a lot of another Lugosi stinker, ""The Devil Bat"" .... the same silly storylines and bad acting and same silly 'reporter gets bad guy' deal. <br /> <br /> But Lugosi is always good - he's scary and scary enough to keep you at least so interested that you continue to persecute him. The woman who plays the reporter was just a horrible actor ... she had no emotions at all, she just delivered her lines like a machine gun and spit it out as fast as she could. Everyone else blew pretty well when it came to being good actors. <br /> <br /> But this thing can be seen, if only for Bela Lugosi fans. Lugosi was always so intense, even if the picture was a dog. He must have known that he made horrible pictures, but maybe he also knew that if he gave it all, he seemed a bit of that intensity through all the bad actions and bad spectacles that surrounded him. <br /> <br /> And he was right - we horror fans will always have a love for Bela Lugosi. He did his best He was in front of the camera. We'll give you two harassments, Bela."

No salvation at all. And I was entertained. I could not stop looking.

It has the flavour of watching Notre Dame play an inferior high school team.","This, and not a slightly overblown Southern Soap Opera, was the biggest epic of Hollywood's greatest year, 1939. I'm not going to repeat the obvious - Cary Grant, Victor McLaglen (who was a Bengali Lancer) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. are doing excellent comic performances. However, I want to notice two other, less understood elements of this masterpiece. The great last fight sequence, as the wonderful Sam Jaffe laboriously climbs to the top of the temple to blow his horn and warn the regiment, is just great. It always fails to inspire me. Another underrated element in the film is Eduardo Ciannelli's appearance as a guru. This is not a caricature of Fu Manchu, but a well-drawn, articulated, historically informed one (""Have you ever heard of Changruputra Maurya? He defeated the armies left behind by Alexander the Great in India""). In fact, one can see parallels between this mystical, evil nationalist and a certain well-known figure of the thirties (A German, not an Indian). Gunga Din, anti-Nazi tract? Not quite. But still, a huge, funny, moving epic."

If this is not one of the best things ever shown on celluloid, I want someone to guide me. Absolutely breathtaking in my opinion, and I have literally worn out my VHS copy to capture her charms.

Well, I'm glad I checked this movie because I really enjoyed it, I think the movie preached a bit, but not only did I mind, I enjoyed the speeches and was never bored with them. <br /> <br /> The acting was outstanding in this film, especially Paul Lukas, Lucile Watson (rightly nominated for an Academy Award), Bette Davis (wrongly not nominated), George Coulouris, and, strangely, Eric Roberts, who plays the middle kid, I really enjoyed his character: a funny-looking boy, d he somehow talks about philosophers. He just makes me angry. Even the name of the character (Bodo) is funny. <br /> <br /> The endin g, in which Luke's character was forced to do something he thought was wrong, even though he was doing it for the right reasons, worked for me as well. I agreed why he felt he needed to do that, and I understood why he could not quite explain it.

Futuristic soldiers who are guided on nasty ass vampires by veterinarian Michael Ironside .... In outer space. I mean, I did not expect high art, but it looked like a potential B movie classic. This was undoubtedly a television pilot who became a feature film some time later, after he was not picked up. Okay, I start with a few good points with the movies, the action was competent for a lower budget movie, and the CGI and the locations used were passable. Now on evil, first Michael Ironside was barley in it, and his performance here .... well, it was cheesy, not in a good way. But as I said, he was not there anyway, so I can not blame him. One thing that was really stupid was the PETA-type group for vampires, no, I'm not kidding, it's the stupidest unbelievable thing I've seen in time, and it's being taken seriously. Also this film commits one of the big B-movie sins, he teases a lesbian scene and does not deliver. Especially what sank this movie, nothing really happens. Since it should be a pilot, the script is almost nonexistent and has no regular ending. Even the main villains do not come in until the end. If ever a movie is needed to increase the sleaze and gore factor, it's Vampire Wars. Finally, I will say the main crew on the spaceship, were all very capable actors and could leave that mess behind and move on to bigger and better things. They just had nothing to do with it."

He claimed to be a half-breed from India. He was indeed so successful and thought well that people came from all over to hear his lectures and be taken along in his wilderness - although he was not a half-breed and all his knowledge came from books or counterfeits! The movie focuses on these and what happened when the fraud was exposed. The acting and the attitudes were great and I really liked the movie (after hanging up unbelief about Brosnan). It was not widely circulated - probably because it was quite cerebral - not a Bond movie or a romance - just a really strange movie about a remarkable man."

On the contrary, my friends and I were pleasantly surprised by this obscure, yet intense, 80s shock feature, which mainly benefits from a handful of brutal images and a downright brilliant casting. Beautiful and ambitious reporter Jennifer Fast and two of her equally attractive friends are traveling to a small Californian town to shoot a documentary about the Jubilee Festival, but their hotel has forgotten to register their booking. In search of a place to stay, the trio meets the overly friendly, but suspicious museum curator Ernest Keller, who invites the girls to his remote country house. Little by little the girls find that Keller and his extremely introverted and submissive sister Victoria hide a dark and murderous secret in their house. ""The Unseen"" can easily be described as a cheap and ultimately perverse fusion of the horror classics ""Psycho"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"". The storyline is a series of familiar subjects infamous and endlessly imitated by these two films, such as twisted family secrets in the basement, voyeurism, crazy inbreeding killers and a very unappetising treatment of chickens. However, I do not consider that a negative comment, as ""The Unseen"" is a totally unpretentious and slightly disturbing thriller that clearly never wanted to be the decade's biggest horror classic. Although the resolution of the plot is rather clear pretty quickly, director Steinmann tries to keep the secret by keeping the evil gift in the house ""unseen"", as the title promises. The casting decisions and theatrical performances are really what lift this sleeper above the level of mediocre. Sydney Lassick, immortalized since his role as over-anxious psychiatric patient Charley Cheswick in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" is truly the ideal choice for the role of Ernest Keller. His persistent friendliness and almost perverse appearance are exactly what the character needed. Even Stephen Furst, who eventually turns from the invisible to the seen, gives away as a ""Junior"" a tremendous achievement. He looks and behaves like an authentic, disabled man and his attempts to get close to Jennifer in the basement are really unnerving. ""The Unseen"" is a slow and predictable, yet potent movie from the early '80s, which fans of 70s exploitation and generally weird stuff will certainly like."

Since then I have always come back to it. It is great! I especially like the first and second clips, ""Creation"" and ""Civilization Rising"". Impressive! That was so cool in the glory days of CG animation. CG is much older than me, because I know that the movie ""Tron"" was written 7 years before my time.

An anti-fascist, a worker of the underground movement, injured many times and wanted by the Nazis, Kurt Muller (Lukas) needs a long vacation on the estate of his wealthy mother-in-law. But he finds out that there is really no escape, as one of the house guests (Coulouris) is suspicious of his true identity and more than willing to sell it. <br /> <br /> In this film, there are great performances, written a lot to bring forth Lillian Hellman's liberal position. It was certainly a powerful propaganda vehicle at the time of its publication, when the evils of war and what happened to people in other countries came to safe American homes. The big controversy of the film today is that Paul Lukas won an Oscar on Humphrey Bogart in ""Casablanca"". Humphrey Bogart was a wonderful screen presence and a fabulous Rick, but Luke is transcendent like Kurt. The monologue he has to kill about the need is heartbreaking, just to mention a scene. <br /> <br /> Although this is not what you would call a Bette Davis movie, here's a masterful introduction to Kurt's faithful and affectionate wife, Sara. Her acting tugs at heart, and the love scenes between Kurt and Sara are beautiful and tender. <br /> <br /> The last half hour of the movie has hit me in tears with the honesty of feeling. Lillian Hellman is not for everyone, but unlike ""The Little Foxes,"" she has written some really likable, wonderful characters and a good story given by Warner Brothers A casting and production values. Highly recommended."

The film follows an ace driver who becomes part of illegal drag racing.","I just registered to make that comment (which quite clearly reflects some of those here) The drama is worse than below average, it explains common stereotypes, has some of the worst depictions of tasteless female objectification (all bod no brain), and has some of the most cheesy lines you know. <br /> <br /> including, but not limited to, ""all right, see what these guys can do"". I should also mention that when they show the crashes with innocent civilians, they end up feeling bad for the innocent people and starting to hate the characters themselves. Eddie Griffin's character is also one of the most stereotypical types of black guys who rub people the wrong way. He may or may not be a good actor, but this movie does not allow such character research. Do you want a movie that puts the audience on the side of the bad guys? Oceans 11.

9,tt0374569,1,"In 1965, Ernesto 'Che' Guevara resigns from his Cuban government posts to secretly make his latest attempt to spread the revolution in Bolivia. After arriving in La Paz, Bolivia late in 1966, by 1967, Che with several Cuban volunteers, have raised a small guerrilla army to take on the militarist Bolivian movement. However, Che must face grim realities about his few troops and supplies, his failing health, and a local population who largely does not share the idealistic aspirations of a foreign troublemaker. As the US supported Bolivian army prepares to defeat him, Che and his beleaguered force struggle against the increasingly hopeless odds.","I sat through both parts of Che last night, back to back with a short bathroom break, and I can not remember when 4 hours passed so fast. I had to psychologically pre-test for a week in advance because I have a real ""thing"" about directors, producers and editors who keep putting up with long quasi-epics, and by and large, I feel like 2 to 2.5 Hours is about right for a movie. So 4 hours seemed to exceed the limits of my tolerance, and I was very uncertain about the whole company. But I will say in advance that this is a beautiful one? Could I say affectionately ?? Made a movie and I'm really glad I saw it. Director Steven Soderbergh is to be congratulated for the clarity of his vision. The fight scenes are like dodging the bullets themselves. <br /> <br /> If there is one person on the planet who does not know, Ernesto 'Che' Guevara was the Argentine physician who helped Fidel Castro overthrow Fulgencio's 1959 Cuban Revolution When I was a kid in the 1960s, Che's picture was everywhere; on blackboards, on t-shirts, on front pages. Che's image has to be one of the most overused of all times. If one relied on the famous pictures, then Che was a very handsome type, the epitome of revolutionary romanticism. Would he have been ugly, I would have wondered if he had ever been so popular in the public performance? Of course, dying boy helps. <br /> <br /> There have already been films about Che (especially the excellent ""Motorcycle Diaries"" of 2004, in which the unbearably sweet Gael Garcia Bernal went on tour as a young Che through South America and saw endemic poverty formed his own Marxist politics), but I do not think anyone has ever tackled the entire story from start to finish, and this two-parter is an ambitious project. I hope it pays off for Soderbergh, but I can only imagine that immediate commercial success was not top priority. <br /> <br /> The first film (The Agentine) shows Che Castro in Mexico and follows her journey to Cuba to start the revolution, and then the trip to New York in 1964 to join the UN turn. Cleverly shot black and white images look like contemporary films, but they are not. The second film (guerilla) returns in 1966 when Che arrives in Bolivia to launch a new revolutionary movement. The second movie is almost exclusively in the woods. As far as I can see, it was mainly filmed in Spain, but I still think it must have been pretty grueling to film. Benicio Del Toro is excellent as Che, a part of whom he seems born to play. Personally, I felt that ""The Argentine"" (Part 1) was much easier to watch and more entertaining in the movie sense because it is optimistic. You win; The revolution will succeed. Che is a leader in his element, a disparate gang of peasants, workers, and intellectuals in the revolutionary cause. The second part is much harder to observe due to the inevitability of his defeat. Just as the youngest Valkyrie - although a good movie - was an exercise in witnessing heroic failure, so did I feel in the second part of Che (guerrilla). We know from the beginning that he is dying, we know he is failing. It is frustrating because the manner in which the story is told is quite early obvious that the revolt of the revolution in Bolivia is doomed to failure; Che is considered a foreign invader and does not associate with the indigenous peoples, as he did with the Cubans. He persistently insists on what is frustrating to observe because I felt he should have known when to give up and move on to other, perhaps more successful companies. The movie does not romanticize him too much. He kills people, he executes, he struggles with his asthma and follows a lost cause long after he should have given up, and moves on, leaving a woman alone to raise five fatherless children. <br /> <br /> But overall, an excellent exercise in classic filmmaking. A note; As I watched the US-trained Bolivian soldiers arrive en masse to pick up Che and his little warband one by one, it reminded me of Butch Cassidy's final. I almost turned to my husband and said it, but hesitated, thinking he would find such thoughts banal and out of place. When we left the theater, he turned to me and said, ""Did not you think the end was like Butch Cassidy?"""

It is almost silent, relies largely on his wondrous images, and also on his fantastic, symphonic score by Giuseppe Becce. It is a masterpiece of cinematography and music, yes, and also of editing, directing, writing and acting. A good 90% of the film moves perfectly. Machatý seems to be an expert in the use of motifs. Maybe not as subtle as it could be, and maybe a bit overused, but the look of things like insects, lights, and horses makes the story wonderful. Fortunately, the small dialogues of the dialogue are not intrusive. They do not crawl as you would imagine. The last bit is weird, to say the least. Reminiscent of Russian silent films, we have a montage of workers. This makes little sense in the story, but it's so great that I refuse to listen too much to that mistake.

10,tt0828154,1,"THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA takes the viewer on an exhilarating ride through some of the greatest movies ever made. Serving as presenter and guide is the charismatic Slavoj Zizek, acclaimed philosopher and psychoanalyst. With his engaging and passionate approach to thinking, Zizek delves into the hidden language of cinema, uncovering what movies can tell us about ourselves. Whether he is untangling the famously baffling films of David Lynch, or overturning everything you thought you knew about Hitchcock, Zizek illuminates the screen with his passion, intellect, and unfailing sense of humour. THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO CINEMA cuts its cloth from the very world of the movies it discusses; by shooting at original locations and from replica sets it creates the uncanny illusion that Zizek is speaking from 'within' the films themselves. Together the three parts construct a compelling dialectic of ideas. Described by The Times in London as 'the woman helming this Freudian inquest,' director ...","There is a danger with critic / philosopher Slavoj Zizek's film, directed by Sophie Fiennes, who brings together a wonderful mix of silence, horror, sci-fi, surreal and other contemporary thrillers to overload his Freudian comparisons , But in Pervert's Guide to Cinema, he also makes the wider points the starting point of another analysis that I saw in a common section of films. While it does not cover the vast territory covered by Scorsese's documentary films, there are the same attachments, and Zizek has a definite love for all these ""perverted"" examples and films, notably the works of Hitchcock, Lynch, Chaplin and Tarkovsky. But you should not go into it - if you can find it, that's, I've almost seen it by accident - that Zizek will only try to dissect all the psychosexual parts or parts that call it in a dull, disturbed state way. If anything, he opens up a point that may never be considered otherwise - think three Marx brothers as representing id, super ego, and ego (Harpo's example is the deadliest for me). > <br /> He's not just a classic, he's also thinking about food for thought in The Matrix and Fight Club - depicting the separation between fantasy and reality, and when the matrix needs energy as much as energy needs the matrix for the former and the attachment of violence in dealing with one's self as well as the double in the latter. He even throws a piece at the crucial moment in ""The Revenge of the Sith"" when Anakin Darth becomes Vader, and the consequences of avoiding paternity under that back mask the moment the birth of his children happens elsewhere. The ideals of fatherhood, male sexuality, a male point of view when it comes to putting the fantasy into reality (in which Zizek rightly points out the time of creating a nightmare), and female subjectivity are perhaps the most profoundly explored with Vertigo. This is also true of a scene that deconstructs Zizek, as if it were the Zapruder film, in which he dissects in Blue Velvet the three clashing psycho-sexual positions in the scene ""Do not watch me"". <br /> <br /> Now it would be one thing for Zizek to include those straight, excited and somehow plausible points in the camera or, like Scorsese, mostly in voice-over. But he goes one step further to emphasize his points of fantasy and reality, and how they overlap, intersect, become one and the same, or spread more into an underworld or a primitive feeling for some characters (eg Lost Highway) the places where the films take place. The funniest thing is to see him first in the boat heading for the same jetty. Tippi Hedren's boat arrives at the beginning of the birds; Equally funny, when watering the Blue Velvet turf, he goes on to explain the multi-layered points of Frank Booth; only one, when in a Solaris-like area, seems a bit cheesy. But Zizek seems to have a lot of fun with this set-up and after a while you bypass the potential core of this gimmick and Zizek's words come through. <br /> <br /> There were some movies that I would of course make I expected, especially from Hitchcock and Lynch, but a treat for movie fans come from two things to watch - the movies you never see in a movie Watching movies like Pervert's Guide to Cinema (Top two for me would be the Disney Pluto cartoon and the exhibition on Chaplin's films, albeit with a big note about the power and distinction of the ""voice"", and the ones you still have has not seen (eg, the ventriloquist horror film, Dr. Mabuse, Stalker, among a few others), the immediate feelings of ""wow, I must see immediately, no questions asked."" Zizek is a powerful writer with his work, and brings it with a clarity that reminds you why we watch movies first to be entertained safely, but also to have that real experience of sitting and having something up there, as he put it, looking into a toilet true one of the greatest films about cinema, and in such a gorgeous close analysis of how Freud works into films about desire, the ego / super ego / ego and the supernatural in the imagination that you may never see. ..our distribution is finally coming, if only on the smallest levels."

The actual show-runner, Brannon Braga, did not help with his uninspired and tired repetition of earlier Trek episodes and careless disregard for the franchise's internal mythology (it was painfully clear from an early age that he was only there for the paycheck). I have never seen a series that has done such a long service to a talented actor (except Jolene Blaylock) for so long. It's as if this entire series was produced in a bubble that exists outside of the contemporary television landscape, where audiences (even a Trekker audience) are more demanding and demanding in their dramatic desires and yearnings.

He accepts, but he doesn't know that Ronny Bowers does not want to lend him his voice again. So everybody starts to play his little game to solve his own problems.","When we talk about the Hollywood Hotel, we could talk about one of three things, the actual hotel, the radio program, and this movie, which was partly inspired by the first two. Dick Powell hosted the Hollywood Hotel Program on CBS Radio Network, in which Louella Parsons distributed the weekly ball on the stars. <br /> <br /> Powell and Parsons debuted the Hollywood Hotel Program in 1934, so by 1937 had its fair share of the radio audience. Powell hosted, sang and chatted with Louella and her movie star guests. With the power she had with her column, she was able to get the various stars to clog their latest movies for nothing. <br /> <br /> Then the American Federation of Radio Artists came in and demanded that she pay wages accordingly and they won the case. This ended the program of the Hollywood Hotel in 1938. Of course Powell and Louella also went to other radio stations. The whole story is covered in the Tony Thomas book The Films Of Dick Powell. <br /> <br /> But before the plug was pulled, this movie came from Powell's Warner Brothers home studio, inspired by the radio program. Powell plays a singer / saxophonist with the band Benny Goodman, which signs a contract in Hollywood. But when he comes to Hollywood, he gets into a selfish movie star named Lola Lane, her doppelganger Rosemary Lane and a ham actor in Alan Mowbray. <br /> <br /> When Mowbray is asked to sing in a Civil War epic he makes with Lola Lane, it is Powell's voice that they use. Then Mowbray develops a Lina Lamont problem when asked to go to the Hollywood hotel radio program broadcast by the Hollywood Hotel. This has the studio in a dizzy state. Suppose the problem is not resolved, as it is in Singing In The Rain, but Powell's manager Ted Healy proves to be resourceful. <br /> <br /> Richard Whiting and Johnny Mercer deliver really good music for the movie. The big hit comes right at the beginning when the band of Benny Goodman sings the Hollywood anthem Houray for Hollywood with Scat Johnnie Davis. My favorite is Powell and Rosemary Lane sing, I'm like a fish out of the water. Listening to Johnny Mercer's texts about Ginger Rogers with the Brooklyn Dodgers or Sally Rand without her fan, it's a compendium of American pop culture in the 1930s. <br /> <br/> Busby Berkeley does the choreography here and while the movie is not I do not have the imposing imaginary stuff that has his previous work with Warner Brothers, the numbers are well staged. Berkeley's big moment is in a drive-in pub where Powell and Healy had to take jobs. The number starts with Benny Goodman broadcasting from the Hollywood Hotel Let's Do a Lesson to You and then on Drive-in Powell, Lane and the entire place begin to join Song to the despair of owner Edgar Kennedy. And you know what to expect from Edgar Kennedy's despair. <br /> <br /> Benny Goodman shows why he was named King Of Swing when the band with drummer Gene Krupa and xylophone player Lionel Hampton was part of his ensemble. Sing along with Frances Langford. And maybe the last surviving cast member of the group was a guy who had a little bit as a radio announcer. He died in 2004, but not before he became the 40th President of the United States.

It was badly written, badly played and badly done. <br /> <br /> It had some interesting plot points, but they were just skipped too fast, the authors had to realize what they should keep and expand these parts, as if they were lying, kidnapped, and throwing away the slag , Instead, it was ""what's up?"", 5 seconds later they tell you. <br /> <br /> This film had no tension and I was bored from start to finish.

The world appears to suffer from rampant poverty, violence and spiritual desperation and the relentless news media force-feeds these images to the Spanish people. A popular reality television show lets the audience decide between life or death for suspected felons, and one of the opportunistic pan-handlers attempts to escape poverty through this raucous and sensational TV program.","Salva and his friend Bigardo spent most of their lives on the edge of the law. We see them in a car of the subway, where their pitch to get donations is so boring, nobody gives them anything! Salva, who is a hardened petty criminal, does not even have redeeming qualities until he discovers a reality show on television that gives him the idea of ​​what to do next. Religion and show business prove to be a winning combination that benefits Salva. <br /> <br /> He and Bigardo were imprisoned after the accidental death of a priest who had criticized the duo. Salva shows that he is a natural for the reality show. He transforms himself into a Christ-like figure, which is an instant success in the program. Espe, who is a no-nonsense woman who is the producer of the show, can not escape the way Salva pays her unusual attention. After all, Salva is the victim of his own success. <br /> <br /> Jordi Molla, whose first directorial work is this film, has had some success in the way the film satirises the role of television. Spain, which was prone to this type of program, has seen its share of the bizarre, which the director felt as an attack on the audience, and wanted to make his story from the point of view of the people making a fortune out of the naïve public. <br /> <br /> The cast has some good moments in the movie. Mr. Molla, like any actor who decides to shoot his first game, would have been more effective at focusing on the image in front of the camera. Candela Pena, a good actress, is one of the best reasons to watch the movie. Juan Carlos Villedo, David Gimenez Cacho, Franco Francescoantonio, Florinda Chico and the others responded well to the new director."
3,tt0096118,0,"Angela Baker has undergone years of therapy, electro-shock and sexual reassignment surgeries, and finally landed herself a job in the last place she should be working - camp rolling hills. She has an old fashioned approach as to how camp should be, and an old familiar deadly way of making sure that those who don't follow her rules don't get to come back next summer.","So Angela grew up and got therapy and surgery to turn her into a real daughter rather than the son she was born into, and now she has a job - wait - as a camp counselor! How fitting, right? I know, I love it. However, the first sequel to the Sleepaway Camp franchise follows all the rules of the horror sequel - more blood, more imaginative killings (which are not resourceful, but still more than the original), more nudity, a more polished plot, and generally worse than the original , <br /> <br /> It's entertaining, as is the original, where the characters and wardrobes are so stupid and authentic that you can not help but get a good laugh. At some point, a guy asks Angela, and she says, ""I'll call you,"" and then walks away quickly. The guy says to himself, ""How will she call me? I do not have a phone!"" and then he sniffs his armpits and wonders what she's got off (it's the hair, old man !!). <br /> <br /> It is a known fact that in the 1980s the murdered teenagers were more likely than not punished by their killer for some kind of bad behavior, usually for being too promiscuous. It was not clear to me when I started making horror films and seeing the thirteenth movie for the first time in the mid-90s. I learned it in a movie class a year or two later and was amazed that it was a method of madness. I was quite impressed, not only that the films conveyed some kind of message, albeit a morbid one, but that in fact something was being thought about. <br /> <br /> But not in this movie! Just before Angela kills one of her victims, she says, ""Let that be a lesson to you, say no to drugs!"" Real subtle screen font, guys. On the other hand, the dialogue is the most entertaining in the film. Angela (who, by the way, went through all this therapy and these surgeries and all the trouble to clean up her past and reinvent herself as a normal and well-developed person, then changed her name from Angela to, um, Angela), says at one point ""I do not like being the evil witch of the West, but I know what happens when things get out of hand."" (People start getting killed ... by me! HA!) <br /> <br /> Later, she asks that one of the counselors, Mare, make an excuse, to which the girl replies, ""I would rather to die!"" I'm sorry, Mare, but you've really come across this one ... <br /> <br /> Two years ago, I was a camp counselor in a camp similar to the one in this movie (except in the camp where I taught) had more than three kids among the 15 or 20 guidebooks and it also had rules that were not in the movie). This made me realize the myriad discrepancies in the movie about how camp life really is. <br /> <br /> That's alright, you can barely make such a movie with so many 9 year olds, even though 10 or 11 year old kids were killed in this movie. I had never seen anything like it before. <br /> <br /> Definitely bad taste, even for a cheesy 80s Slasher movie ...."

The main problem for me was the cast of Glover as a serial killer. I do not know if it's from the casting or just from his behavior, but I doubt Glover would ever be a convincing villain. He's a good guy, and that's always obvious in his performances. Apart from that, the movie is your serial killer story. Nothing very innovative."

But he was not too lucky with his latest work. Gloria (1999) was pathetic and Find Me Guilty was an interesting but failed experiment. Now Lumet brings his best movie in decades and, in my opinion, a true masterpiece: before the devil knows you're dead. I think this movie is like a rebirth for Lumet. This movie has an excellent story that is deep, has many layers. Also, I think the end of the movie is perfect. The services are brilliant. Philip Seymour Hoffman does a great job, as usual, and he is undoubtedly one of the best actors of our time. Etha Hawke is also an excellent actor, but he is underestimated from my point of view. His performance here is great. The rest of the cast is also excellent (especially the great Albert Finney), but these two actors bring monumental achievements, unfortunately by the. were ignored pathetic Oscars.

I read it in my ninth grade and it was great. We also decided that it would be good to watch the movie. The movie was so disappointing for me. The film cuts out some characters and misses many of the main points of the book. It jumps around a lot and does not explain anything in detail. If anyone had seen this film without first reading the book, they would be confused. The most disappointing thing about this film for me was the end. The end in the book was the most powerful and in the movie they changed it! It was meant to be pigs and men in an alliance and somehow ""melted together,"" but instead, the film made it look like the animals were rebelling against the pigs.

Too much love for the music, too many parties, too much contrast between the nice life of the leading actor (come on, it is not so sad) and the aspect of the city that the director shows. For me everything looks too phony: the families, the relationships, the music, the ""happiness"". It just sells a little taste of a wrong Latin American culture. To be honest, it seduced me a little, but who would not be seduced by those wrong lives that consist of good music, sex and parties?

Screenwriter and director Mike Binder (""The Head of Anger"" and Sandler's accountant in this film) brings the film a different look and feel. Some of the scenes do not work as well as others, but overall it's well written and solid. <br /> <br /> Sandler and Cheadle are both excellent. Sandler's character is a bit reminiscent of his good performance in ""Punch Drunk Love,"" but here he brings much more depth. Cheadle is always alright and does a nice job of expressing the burden he carries ... just by watching him work a puzzle. <br /> <br /> Support work is by Jada Pinkett Smith (as Cheadle's wife), Liv Tyler (as a very patient psychiatrist), Saffron Burrows (in a strangely appealing role), Donald Sutherland as Irritated Judge, and Melinda Dillon and Robert Klein as Sandler's in-laws. <br /> <br /> The film really touches on how the tragic events of the day hit a person so deeply that it is basically ruined. In addition to the interesting story and some great shots of NYC, you have to love every movie that plays with voices from Chrissy Hynde, Bruce Springsteen, and Roger Daltrey ... as well as Eddie Vedder, who imitates Daltrey. Not just a hipper upbeat movie, but it's a quality movie with an unusual story."

After realizing that she has difficulties coping, the mother, Tammy, decides to place Jesse with a family that has taken in several similar children. Jesse's grandparents object, believing that he will be better off living with his real family. As Tammy's mother starts fighting for custody over the child, she reawakens old hostilities between herself and her daughter, and the entire family is affected.","Although I disagree with Bob and Tammy's decision to give birth to Baby Jesse, and it's something I would never do, they tried to do what was best for the baby. As this film is written, you see yourself trapped in history and ask yourself what you truly believe, from all different aspects. Patty Duke? Opponent? As far as I know, almost unheard of. But during the movie, she really convinces you that she is psychotic, or at least that something is seriously wrong with her. Her character is the meaning of ""emotionally disturbed"". The movie seems to end quickly and does not leave things unresolved. But otherwise this movie is really great. It really makes you think. It's not a movie you can see when you just want to sit back and relax and see something sweet that makes you laugh. But it's a good movie to see when you challenge your own beliefs, see things from the perspective of others, and discover something about yourself. Caution: You can even grow while watching this movie! And in the end it's all worth it."

He tries to convince local officials to find everyone who may have been in contact with the dead man. The Mayor supports his efforts but many, including the police, are doubtful. Reed wants to avoid publicity so as not to panic the public. They have little information to go on - they don't know the dead man's identity - and Reed estimates they have 48 hours before disease begins to spread. With police Capt. Tom Warren going through the motions, Reed sets out to find the killers.","I can not really condemn the movie because it works. There are enough Film Noir elements to consider it a Noir movie, but I think it's just in the category. <br /> <br /> There is nothing sinister in this piece, and here the Noir elements fail. Sure, the disease could be considered scary, but it's hard for me to see. The film points to a darker side: Blackie can do human trafficking, the New Orleans police are only too willing to arrest a reporter, the ghost of the plague hangs over all the people in the movie ... but that's really just them clues. <br /> <br /> There is no attempt to question Reed's motivations, such as Marlowe or Spade, and there is no attempt to bring a human side to Blackie, which would make him even more contemptible, though the trafficking was actually played out. <br /> <br /> This lack of depth is what makes the movie fail in the end. <br /> <br /> The story is decent, the acting is good, the writing and the direction are well done ... but there is nothing to make this a movie to return to again and again. It is worthwhile to watch once, maybe twice, if you do not remember it years ago and then put it away."

The first part is held with solid comedy from Goundamani, but it is getting worse and utterly illogical. Our hero also takes an archaeological site for Saints of the same name (Baba) through a kitschy and totally lame one-liner. The first half, Rajni has his usual line of oneliner and style and in the second half, becomes a quasi-saint after a beggar gave him through an interdimensional portal into the Himalayas, where Babaji (not the famous saint he digs earlier) give him special powers for no apparent reason (except Karma). That really starts to get interesting, right? <br /> <br /> The rest of the movie is about wasting his magical abilities and powers and warding off politicians and related black magic. The usual predictable crap with hilarious implementation. Oh, and the black magic never worked on our hero because he just happened to have a Param Vir ... he ... Shakti Chakra with him. The bad guys and the usual politician villains are stereotyped, overworked and in the end completely insignificant for the action that goes nowhere. <br /> <br /> But despite all the mistakes, it was fun killing time with Baba-related one-liners during public events. It's also fun to watch others cuss this movie. AR Rehman is said to have composed the tracks for his film over the phone. That's how important he thought. <br /> <br /> Rajni is very popular in Japan and he has two characters (one of them is called Keiko ... why not Samsung?) of Japanese origin in this movie just for the sake of it. But the way they are portrayed, dressed and treated is absolutely pathetic. The Japanese may stop seeing Rajni films after seeing this.

With all due respect, its low rating is representative of the IQ level of those who rated it so poorly. They would rather see a movie with cheap thrill, bigger budget and more gore. <br /> <br /> People's first misconception is that this is a horror movie. It is not, nor does the film lead you to believe that it is one. It's a psychological thriller. It is for people who want an intellectual experience when watching a movie. The Reel.com report is the perfect example of what I think about this movie. All other negative reviews make little sense. It's almost as if you want to make an original film for a change - very rarely in those days - is something bad and not worth it. <br /> <br /> I'll reveal a few spoilers for the idiots who said it was boring and didn It makes no sense. Martha has brainwashed herself and made experiments on herself to be a caring mother, when she was really a nasty Nazi who would kill without warning. The evidence is all in the pudding and the fact that we at first glance sympathize with this cold-blooded monster for the duration of the film is a testament to the direction and writing of the film. <br /> <br /> I definitely feel that this movie should be rated at least in the 6 series on originality. I recommend this movie for the people on the other end of the IQ scale - aka smart people - because this movie is obviously slaughtered by those who would rather see Scream or Freddy's Nightmare. <br /> <br /> Kudos to the actors too. For such a low budget movie, you are amazed that this movie did not hit your local cinema with the big direction, writing and acting. Please do not be fooled by the rating by IMDb.

By night's end, a group of survivors will have to take one final stand against ghouls, ghosts, zombies and vampires.","Horror movies can be a lot of fun with little money, bad behavior, and a bit of swing. I think the film lacks only verve, because a dull scene after another makes people ridiculously harmless with the claw in the air. If it were not so boring, it could be funny. <br /> <br /> A horror movie can go a long way with a weary concept like ""college kids in a haunted house"" in the same way as the bad guys have had a lot of fun with a similar standard plotline. Unfortunately, Hallow's End does not go far. Actually, there is nowhere to go. It spends most of an hour putting up faceless and anonymous characters with endless interpersonal drama. I have nothing against character development, not even in a horror movie, but these are strictly one-dimensional characters (the alpha male, the milquetoast, the ... um ... disposable characters that exist mainly for sex scenes.) Spending more than forty bloodless, Booming minutes with them were more appalling than when the bloodshed began. <br /> <br /> Well, implicit bloodshed anyway. When the college kids become what they wear for their haunted house (one is a vampire wearing O.R Scrubs and some white pancakes), they look the way they did in their amateur haunted house costumes; The Dead Hate The Living, with a similar theme, is a masterpiece in comparison. There is not really any blood that can be talked about, and there are no real scares. <br /> <br /> I have thought about this in almost every approach. If it was a tight, exciting horror movie (which would explain why things were moving so slowly), the pathetic sex scenes and cheap monsters would invalidate it. If it was a real horror movie (which would explain the Schlock) ... where is the blood and the courage? And the anticlimax is one of the unrestrained endings of a movie I've ever seen. It's the kind of movie that, although it has no narrator through the movie, is posted by voice-overs because all the meaningless dialogues just were not enough. <br /> <br /> That was a tough one ... come out, I wonder if I've just had a Christian horror movie. Maybe the ""I know that hell exists"" opening was not meant that way, but there are some clues (or misleading - I'm not sure which). For all the obscenities in the film, a line like ""gosh-darnit"" sounds a bit absurd, and so does most crucifix worship, godly and satanic, especially after a few lustful T & A sex scenes (a heterosexual, a lesbian). <br /> <br /> If it's a Christian company (Highland Myst's logo even has a bit of a crucifix resemblance), then this movie weighs heavily for the atheist camp. An almighty being can not be such a bad filmmaker. <br /> <br />"

The Creed's neighbours are reluctant to talk about the cemetery, and for good reason too.","The trivia section for Pet Sematary states that George Romero (director of two Stephen King stories, Creepshow and The Dark Half) would direct and then move out. One wonders what he would have brought to the film, because director Mary Lambert, who is not really a bad director, does not really bring much imagination to this adaptation of King's novel, of which he wrote the screenplay. Of course, there are some very effective, grotesquely surreal scenes (mainly with sister Zelda, who is more likely to be a creep for kids when they watch the movie), and casting in some roles is absolutely perfect. But sometimes something feels missing, a style that could correspond to the unmistakably king-like atmosphere, which in this case is about as morbid as you can get from the tombs without incestuous cannibals if he saves that for his last novel ...) <br /> <br /> As already mentioned, part of the casting is terrific, especially Miko Hughes as Gage Creed, the little boy who is one of the best cutest kids this page of an 80's horror movie, to a little monster (I say that as a compliment, of course, especially in scenes with a specific scalpel). And for Fred Gwynne of the Munsters, who plays this old, mysterious man with the right undertones and undertones, there is also a juicy supporting role. And the applause goes to the one who made make-up for Andrew Hubatsek. But there are some other mistakes in the other cast; Dale Midkiff is good, not great, as the conflicting, disturbed father figure Creed and his daughter Ellie is played by an actress who does not work for me at all. <br /> <br /> In terms of setting up some chilling set pieces, just a few really stand out: a certain moment that compacts the action (not to spoil, it includes a cool Ramones song), and the first visit to the pet Sematar (the larger one), including the kind of mystical overtones that King had in shining. In most cases it is a very demanding director's job, although it could have been even darker to fit the script. When elaborated in logical terms (though in King terms), it is truly one of his more effective works of the period. But it does not add up as it could or should.

Prom Night, a night that should be happy and memorable, becomes hell !! Anyway, I saw it and was extremely disappointed. Not only was it the worst ""horror movie"" I've ever seen, but it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen !! Above all, it was not even scary. There was no moment in this movie when I jumped out of my seat. Besides, the murder scenes were so cheesy and boring. All the Slasher did was stab his victims several times in the stomach or cut their throats. Also, there was absolutely no Gore (his PG-13 rated). The scene with the most blood was probably the one in which the killer murders the black girl. He slits her throat and spills blood on the leaves that hang around her (they do not really show him how to cut their throats). <br /> <br /> Next you'll see the killers when they first get introduced to the movie. He is not mysterious, creepy or scary. He's just the guy who kills people. <br /> <br /> Also everything in the movie was so clichéd. An example is when the killer ends up killing the main character and at the last moment the detective kills and kills him. Besides, every single thing in this movie was so predictable. The victim, after seeing the guy with a knife, runs for their lives, hides, thinks she's going to get away, and then the killer just pops out and kills her. <br /> <br /> Finally, the sequence of the movie was extremely bad. The guy goes to the hotel, kills a few people, the bodies are discovered, someone pulls the fire alarm, and everyone evacuates. The main character forgets something in her room, has an encounter with the killer, runs and flees. That's it! She and her friend go home, the Slasher kills the guards patrolling the house, finds the girl, is then killed by the detective. The movie sequence was so stupid and clichéd. <br /> <br /> If you think about watching this movie only because the preview looked good, trust me, do not waste your time or money. No wonder this movie was shown in the smallest theater in the cinema. My friend and I, along with these two girls sitting in the back, were the only ones in the theater.

Oliver Reed does a great job by portraying Bill Sykes so that you can not help but hope that he comes to a terrible end ... what he does. <br /> <br /> Dancing is cleverly choreographed and fascinated. Oliver can compete with people like My Fair Lady, The Sound of Music, Oklahoma and so on. A movie for the whole family."

Then a storm starts, they are locked up in school and Marty starts to take revenge. <br /> <br /> Pretty silly. The murders are inventive and bloody and there are some spooky atmospheric shots of the abandoned school - but that's it. The humiliations inflicted on Scuddamore are more than cruel (he has moved out, dipped his head in a toilet AND is being burned) and is only uncomfortable to watch. Considering that Scuddamore committed suicide soon after her release, it is almost impossible to see her. This movie is not about being naked. There's a frontal view of Scuddamore (surprising for every movie), but a girl decides to bathe alone ... AFTER they know a killer is after them! And then there is the couple who needs to have sex. This is the kind of movie where the killer seems to know where everyone will be and can teleport to them. It ends with a twist that made me moan and twisted my eyes, then another twist that made me throw something heavy on the TV! The spectacle is bearable - not good, but bearable. Caroline Munro is also there. She is a very beautiful woman, but not much of an actress. <br /> <br /> This will be a 3 for some effectively bloody murders and atmosphere.

Since I'm a man, I'm probably not qualified to fully understand it, but they do a good job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment right from the start.

Everyone has their own ""thing"" to fight with. As soon as they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs, they begin to interact and slowly lose their suspicions. What I enjoyed about this movie is that it was not for cheap comedy if it was possible. It did not try to teach us a lesson. The people who appear without merit are really well-developed people who can see the light.

The director's obsession with the actress who plays the sexy secret agent Dragonfly has clouded his judgment and the film has no ending. A young American, in Paris to document his life on film with total honesty, is brought in to finish the movie with a bang. This proves to be difficult when the line between his fantasy life and reality becomes blurred, and he finds himself seduced by the charms of Dragonfly.","Style, but no substance. Not as funny as it should be. Not as deep as it wants to be. <br /> <br /> This is another in the genre of films about the difficulties of filmmaking. A young filmmaker is hired to end a 60s science fiction movie called Codename: Dragonfly. Think of Barbarella or Danger Diabolique. <br /> <br /> But Jeremy Davies is a fear-obsessed filmmaker. He is not a hack, he is an artist. The movie he wants to make is a diary of his life. Hardly original. <br /> <br /> All characters outside of Jeremy Davies filmmaker are as thin as rice paper. Characters who might be interesting, like his father, his doppelganger, or Jason Schwarzmann as a hack-director, are introduced and then shown the door without adding anything. <br /> <br /> This movie is full of eye candy, but when compared to other films about filmmakers like Stardust Memories or 8 1/2 it fades in comparison. These movies are funny, provocative with well-developed characters. These movies have lessons that apply outside. <br /> <br /> The movie wants to be weird and campy, but it's just deduced and there's no funny scene. The filmmakers describe it as a send-up, but what is the satirical goal? The actors say it's a tribute, but I think I'd rather have a full-length version of Codename: Dragonfly. <br /> <br /> Coppola is obviously amused by the attitude, as the visual humor of science-fiction film shows in a movie. But he does not tell us why we should be amused. <br /> <br /> Outside the science fiction movie, it's just a mess. There is continuity error, the filmmaker chooses a science fiction weapon after it has already been selected. What? <br /> <br /> Just because he has a scene, the filmmaker is confronted with critics who complain about the lack of history, lack of a point, a scene in which he admits empty wisdom does not mean that he has addressed these criticisms. <br /> <br /> I guess if you have your novel Coppola, you can get away with making a movie about a fear-obsessed idealistic filmmaker who does not know what he wants to say and does not say anything. In this sense, it can be considered autobiographical. <br /> <br /> I would see it in Circuit City on a wall of TV if I had the choice. Watch the 15-minute codename: Dragonfly Movies on the DVD as extras, and then send them back."

Take three interest groups: 1) the government 2) the rebels 3) a group of assassins. <br /> <br /> Now pull the first one (they never appear in the movie). Then let one of the assassins, the princess, become a villain on a revenge journey. Add a rebel love interest with a bad conscience.

As it is, the film's only virtue (if you can call it that) is its eccentric nature: Stevens, who plays a widow in revenge on the man who betrayed her revolutionary husband, sleeps in a coffin (!) in a carriage driven by her silent servant (?) Sutton; Savalas, as a bloodthirsty defector, who seems at first glance to be the main villain of the film, is sent by his own henchman Lettieri very early in the picture; the villain of the play then turns out to be Landau, who in the very first scene of the film will plunder side by side our legendary hero, who has become a priest Shaw; Fernando Rey, who plays a blind pawn, is the only one who can identify the rebel Shaw, who ends up with only one front for ... well, forget it! As you can see, the plot is very confusing and it gets weirder and weirder!

The film was very similar to the events of September 11, when a bin Laden-style terrorist sent a video to the president (Urich) and threatened to detonate it. Judson Mills had some great action roles, eliminating Rashid's team and various kick-butt roles, but Chuck Norris was missing.

With Barricade Timo Rose tries to give the well-worn routine a Teutonic twist by transplanting the plot to the Black Forest and giving her the German low-budget splatter treatment. The result is a very bloody but totally unoriginal effort that is made almost unimaginable thanks to some terrible directing decisions - especially the incessant use of fancy filters and irritating editing techniques. <br /> <br /> Had Timo Rose decided not to use every trick his editing software offered, and then perhaps Barricade had been a pretty entertaining Glefest: his inexperienced troupe was doing reasonably well. the bloody effects are suitably gastric vertebrae; and there are a scare or two and even some well thought out scary moments. However, all of this is completely destroyed by the terrible camera work, the restless editing and the overwhelming flood of visual gimmicks that give the film the desperate look that is so inexplicably popular with today's filmmakers. <br /> <br /> I'm giving Barricade 3 out of 10 for the weird Gore, which has a nifty scene where a guy needs to drink acid, lots of nasty wounds caused by a lot of spicy gadgets, and some pretty proper shotgun damage."

The camera work and the editing are brilliant and in combination with the narrative trends of alienation used in the film creates an uncanny and unforgettable cinematic experience. <br /> <br /> The participation of Barbara Suwkowa and Eddie Constantine in the cast are two guilt feelings to be seen and enjoyed.

Some were pointed out by the creators of this site, others were not. I will not point out all the others, but here are a few more to see: When the young daughter goes to the beginning of the movie, the hook comes to the cage door and the hook to the right of it clearly goes behind the round button, making sure that Roddy does not come out and he just does it by just stepping on it. At one point the ruby ​​falls on Roddy's back and is pushed straight into the air by Rita during the entire time the ship is moving forward. In the next scene, Roddy caught it again. That's impossible. As the ship moved forward, the only place where the ruby ​​was thrown out from behind Roddy's shirt was the only place he could land, in the water, not in Roddy's hand. There was a third thing I wanted to point out, but at the moment I forgot it. <br /> <br /> Too many, for lack of a better word, ""jokes"" were repeated in one way or another, there was not enough time to make any kind of connection with any of the characters that were characters hollow, shallow and empty, and the whole movie left a want to see ... 85 minutes of everything else!

Pure Hollywood and, if I go to Tierney's place, I doubt I would react the same way. A small point of criticism for a film by Ben Hecht and directed by Otto Preminger.

One day her attention is drawn to a noisy argument being conducted largely in German in a neighbouring house, the more so since one of those involved is her main senator prosecutor. Starting to look into things, she gradually enlists the help of FBI officer Cochran who was initially detailed to check her out. Just as well when things turn nasty.","Watching beautiful women sneaking around, policemen and robbers playing is one of the most delightful guilty pleasures the medium of film offers me. So The House on Carroll Street was not a waste of time, though the story was invented and the script was uninspired and somewhat irritating. <br /> <br /> There are many allusions to various Hitchcock images, not least the choice of Kelly McGillis in the lead role. She's disguised as Grace Kelly, and she's not far from the mark. Not at all. But her character does not convince. As presented to the public, she should be someone with political beliefs and a purpose in life. After all, the film is about a clearly defined period, true events and a specific problem. But in the first few minutes, the story devours into a horrific crime story with incredible coincidences, high predictability and a series of two-dimensional characters. This is all the more regrettable as the performances of the actors are good, as well as the photography and stage design. <br /> <br /> The final at Central Station in New York is breathtaking. It starts in the underground section and then moves to the roof. The film can be praised for its good use of the architecture."

Before the day ends under a full moon, twenty lives intersect time and again in unpredictable, connected ways: a jilted lover holds a souvenir pebble, a stolen coffee maker looks suspicious at a Metro stop, a yellow rain slicker is passed on as a gift, lettuce causes a bicycle accident, a leaf betrays an habitual liar who's just told the truth, and an Algerian waiter, also born 11 March 1977, sees a bug cross a tablecloth.

Ever. Ever. Ever. The true translation, ""The Beat of the Butterfly Wings,"" is strangely not used as a translated title. I suppose they thought most Americans would not know what chaos theory is (except for those who have seen or read Jurassic Park). The film is based on chaos theory and how a small event affects the outcome of seemingly unrelated events, all of which are traced back to an event. The movie is a whirlwind of miraculous cause and effect as we follow the chain of chaos as it traps between several characters (about 20?). In a sense, the end seems inevitable, but if you think about it, it's a perfect ending. Think of yourself: ""What else should be said?"" It is also a very courageous ending. Too bad we have to go overseas for a jewel like this, but an end like this would NEVER come from Hollywood. <br /> <br />"

The Rohauer blurb warns that 1954 three-aged nitrate pressure was rediscovered and salvaged just in time for incineration, and many frames that appeared to be hopelessly stuck together were severed. Well, it's rocky in some places, but I've seen much worse and survived. <br /> <br /> It would have been OK, like the 3 short films, but as an interpretation of intolerance it is inventive and witty from the beginning.

Also in this film we see Resnais' family members such as Pierre Arditi, Sabine Azema, André Dussolier and Fanny Ardant dealing with serious issues such as death, religion, suicide, love and their overall impact on our daily lives. The formal nature of the relationship shared by these people is obvious, as even friends, they address themselves with a formal one. In 1984, while L'amour à mort, Resnais dealt with time, memory and space to unlock the secrets of a fundamental question of human existence: is love stronger than death? Sixteen years ago, in 1968, Resnais made a similar film Je t'aime Je t'aime, which also dealt with love and memories. The message of this film is loud and clear: true and deep love can even shame science dead love their lost lives back and let the doctors look after their reputation. L'amour a mort is like a game that is not at all didactic. It is a film in which the music is in perfect tandem with his pictures of the reasons why this film is easy to understand."

Well, I've rented it and I have to say that even though it caught my attention for most Slasher movies like ""April Fools Day"", ""Friday 13th."" and ""Prom Night"" has kept, this movie could have been right up there with the above just lacking real enthusiasm and potential from the characters as well as the ongoing story. Characters that I unfortunately found in this movie were the guys with the frizzy hair who crawled around in the dorm and of course led to its true climatic role when confronted with the killer. Another would be the dirty, shabby guy with the denim jacket, he could have played more roles in this movie that would have made the movie more interesting, instead the movie played this guy as another loser out there making unknown phone calls while he sleeps with his girlfriend and then his part falls and cuts him to the end, which was a waste, I was disappointed in his role in the end. As for the true identity of the killer when the identity was published, who I was, I just laughed, but it was all too obvious and he really made a true idiot out of himself as well as an annoying character after his true intentions were revealed. This movie should be one that at least once watches out for all Slasher fans but does not spend their hard-earned money on it in a rare, hard-to-find collector's inventory."

This not only enhances the film's focus on Lincoln's central role, but also gives the audience a refreshing glimpse of Lincoln as a man of his time and place, a man who, like each of us inexorably, immerses himself in the themes and feelings his time and sought his way to solve it. It's not so much through Fonda Lincoln's words and deeds, but in the faces, the reactions of the supporting players, that Ford tells the story of the formation of Lincoln's world view, the sense of place in society and community, and how people insist on it Mr. Lincoln's words and deeds responded and trusted this man, whom they had respected and respected. Give it a try: Instead of focusing on Henry Fonda, next time you see, Young 'Mr. Lincoln shifts the focus to the supporting characters - they'll be rewarded, I think, with a deeper appreciation from Lincoln and Ford.

Overrated because the supposed ""realism"" he introduces (grinding crowds, crumbling architecture, etc.) is thrown up by the absurd and downright silly way the characters behave. In search of realism, Pasolini used many non-actors, but their glances at the deer in the spotlight and the painfully awkward line deliveries give the whole thing a terribly out of balance and contradictory feeling. And frankly, many of the toothless, misshapen people are painful to look at. <br /> <br /> And Pasolini's ""Decameron"" is troubling (at least for me) because of the casual and prevalent homosexual content. Not because I am prude or homophobic (neither am I), but because the emphasis Pasolini places on homoerotic images and situations contradicts the neo-realism that he otherwise advocates, and therefore seems superfluous and forced. You can almost hear him say ""Ooh - I have to put a sweet, naked boy in this scene!"" It sometimes seems that Pasolini is trying to play the homosexual angle in order to nip the critics, and sometimes because he enjoys this aspect himself, regardless of what his viewers prefer. <br /> <br /> The incoherence of the 9 or 10 different stories in Pasolini's ""Decameron"" seemed to me a Pasolini storyteller failure rather than an aspect of neorealism. He seems bored with every story and so he packs them with little conviction and with little conviction. Even the last dialogues of Pasolini in the film, which some people seem to find succinctly (""Why create a work of art when you dream about it is so much sweeter?"") - that just makes me wonder why Pasolini would do it Movie, if he felt like that? In my opinion, Fellini's ""Satyricon"" is a much better movie (and with MORE homosexual content). It is also full of bizarre-looking people and absurd situations, but it succeeds because of its tempo, direction, and strong narrative style, while ""Decameron"" fails on the same elements."

It has a great-looking monster, some good low-budget effects, some atmosphere, but it does manage to bridge the goodies with bad. Halfway I started to fast forward and then go through the chapters on the DVD. <br /> <br /> The problems with this film are manifold. At first, the cast looks about thirty and yet they are supposed to be in high school. They do not believe in the result as a result. The scarecrow looks good, but not much beyond that. He says silly liners and moves in a way that's weird rather than scary. Is this a comedy or a horror movie? It's a problem that goes beyond the individual liners and builds much of the dialogue. It seems to send more of every cliché than a heartfelt horror movie. I expect the movie is meant for a very close audience, horror fans who want to mock the genre instead of embracing it. <br /> <br /> Despite the good-looking monster, this is a movie to avoid. Even if you get it for less than five dollars in the special items, you pay too much. <br /> <br /> Me."

If you like unique thrillers influenced by Film Noir, then this is just the cure for all the Hollywood summer blockbusters that are clogging the movie theaters these days. Trier's follow-ups like Breaking the Waves have gained more recognition, but that's really his best work. It is striking without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of excitement and dark humor. It is a pity that he has decided that handheld cameras are the wave of the future.

To be honest, it has less to do with the fact that it is less popular and more with the fact that people would rather buy DVDs now to see the episodes uncut on the internet. This movie probably did not have that many cuts and the voice was okay for a dubbed movie, though I'd rather see the original Japanese version. Americans tend to use some pretty annoying voices for kids in anything that gets dubbed. This movie shows a young boy climbing a train called Galaxy Express, hoping to make it into a planet that has the technology to turn it into a robot. He wants to become a robot to avenge his mother, who was brutally murdered by a robot chasing people for fun. In the course of his adventures, he meets friends with the various workers aboard the train, as well as a woman who resembles his late mother, a beautiful woman named Matel, who, like most women in anime films, has a secret that either really could be good for our young hero or really bad.

How bad is it? It's terrible, which is a ""1"" on the IMDb scale - but it's a lot worse. It's nice to imagine that original German-language printing could improve things - the English-language comedic dubbing is not funny at all - but truthfully, this is one of the worst amateur movies of all genres you'll likely see. The zombies in the movie are as slow and awkward as ever, and they do not seem to have the ability to talk or think about their next meal. But they are also smart enough to chain-saw and malicious enough to know that Western taboos on genitals will undoubtedly liven up their table talk. George Romero's Land of the Dead set a zombie nation that maintained a sense of social coherence; Here, zombies are nothing but a blank canvas for the perverted ideas of director Andreas Schnaas.

Devil's experiment, in particular, has some truly fantastic effects - not just the infamous eyeball scene, but also a very realistic skin on the foot and a hand slamming with a sledgehammer are very realistic - especially for the vintage and low budget of the videos. <br /> <br /> Let me start now for those who do not know: This film is an ""extreme"" torture / counterfeiting snuff movie that appeared in Japan in the mid-1980s. The story is simple: a young girl is being held by a few men and forced to brutally torture herself to see where her break point lies. This brings with it brutal violence - all realistic effects including those mentioned in the last paragraph, as well as a painful-looking application of hot oil to the trapped girl's arm and the insertion of maggots into the subsequent flaky wound. <br /> <br /> The least effective sequences are at the very beginning of the video and consist of an unconvincing slap session, in which three men take turns banging their heads and a second sequence in which the three Men take turns kicking the girl and pushing her to the floor. These two scenes are obviously staged and diminish the realism of the rest of the process. <br /> <br /> The actress who plays the victim of the ""experiment"" is quite convincing in having pain and takes a lot of it with abuse and gross things in front of the camera. Her reactions, how she strapped headphones to her head and loud noises for hours are played, are frightening. Some of the other maltreatments she takes are suspended in a net from a tree during the only time they rest. There is also a disturbing scene in which the giggling kidnappers go through their bowels and another nasty greasy scene where they spin in an office chair and are forced to drink a bottle of Jack Daniels until they puke. <br /> <br /> If you have not seen this series.

Not as ""fancy"" as the TOS-based series New Voyages (which sometimes features some of the original series actors / writers like Walter Koenig, aka Mr. Chekov), Rob and the cast and crew of HF manage to create a series that deserves to replace the gruesome experiment we called ""Enterprise."" The most controversial and successful story arc was the launch of Star Trek's first openly gay character, Corey Aster (who was introduced in the second season), and his search for a soulmate. Somewhere later in the series, he meets Jorian Zen, the Excelsior Trill helm officer. In the final storylines with these two characters (CAUTION: MAJOR SPOILER!

Although the future is uncertain - since the last episode ""Beachhead"" was shown to the fans in the chatroom last night - I think this relationship will last, but only time will tell. <br /> <br /> Gene Roddenberry has created Star Trek with the intention that the story is more about his characters than flashy space battles. For the same reason, Rob Caves created Hidden Frontier - and that has made this series as popular as it is. As the previous comment said, I wish I could give it a rating of more than 10, but it will have to suffice. Although the next season will be the last - in the tradition of the seven seasons of Star Trek: The Next Generation - I'm sure we'll hear a lot about Hidden Frontier after this final episode."

The acting was not bad and it looked like it had a budget, but there was no way to make it worth seeing; not even the presence of beautiful bare breasts. Maybe I should have triggered a doobie or had to drink a lot of beer to get the full experience of the movie. Anyway, I'm not watching this movie unless I'm really depressed. Then I can tell myself, ""At least I was not in Dr. Tarr's torture dungeon."" I'm better than these guys. """

Orca is not exactly a ""Jaws rip-off"", but it's obvious he's been trying to capitalize on Jaw's success. Above all, Orca was in my opinion a bad movie, not terrible, but definitely not good, on average at most. <br /> <br /> The plot is basically a male killer whale (Orca), having seen his buddy and his unborn calf killed by a fisherman seeking revenge. I could not bear to see this movie again. The direction of this film is bad and compared to Jaws it looks like the director, the producers and the authors are almost without talent. <br /> <br /> As far as acting is concerned, it was very average and believable, but the actual characters are not the least bit sympathetic. The effects were fine for his time and the killer whale shots looked pretty good. <br /> <br /> The violence is confusing, bloody and not recommended for sensitive people. The music is exaggerated and very loud, drowning the sound effects and sometimes irritating. I hated the way they exaggerated the killer whale's intelligence (killer whales do not mate with just one buddy, as depicted in Orca). Overall, this movie was in my opinion bad / bad because of the reasons mentioned above. Some people may appreciate this movie more because of the concept of revenge among animals and humans, so I will not beat this movie and I can understand why some people like it. <br /> <br /> My rating: 3.5 / 10 (but maybe 5/10 for his concept)"

The three children in the family then flee from home to Washington D.C. to win the then United States President, Herbert Hoover. This hike offers some side stories such as her positive encounters with a hobo and a puppeteer, making the story seem like a Disney Animal on the Run movie and does not quite fit here. In the end, there are no details about how the president helped the family, and I think that's another downpoint to the movie. The movie finally brings tears, but it takes too long to come to that. The movie should not have been an original TV movie (according to IMDb), but it has the obvious fades that make it look like this? That's why I'm not sure if their information is correct.

The trip across Europe in a broken-down car is also the departure of his father: upon arrival in Mecca, both Reda and his father are not the characters they were at the start of the movie. Avoiding the hackneyed theme of the return to the homeland, the film uses the departure to renew a connection between two generation.","LE GRAND VOYAGE is a gentle wonder of a movie, a work deepened by the simple script of author and director Ismaël Ferroukhi, which allows the natural scenery of this road trip story and the sophisticated spectacle of stars Nicolas Cazalé and Mohamed Majd, to carry the emotional impact of the movie. Ferroukhis' vision is through the cinematography of Katell Djian (a sensitive mix of travelogues of horizons and densely photographed duets between characters) and the music of Fowzi Guerdjou, who manages to preserve some beautiful themes during the film while pays homage to the film proves, very cleverly expanded many local musical variations from the numerous countries of the film surveys. <br /> <br /> Reda (Nicolas Cazalé) lives with his Muslim family in southern France, a young student with a western girlfriend who does not seem to follow the religious direction of his heritage. His older father (Mohamed Majd) has decided that his time has come to bring his hajj to Mecca. Since he can not drive, he asks the reluctant Reda to neglect his personal needs to do him his religious duty. The two set off in a fragile automobile to travel to Saudi Arabia through France, Italy, Bulgaria, Croatia, Slovenia and Turkey. During the trip, Reda asks his father to visit some of the interesting sites, but his father remains focused on the purpose of the trip and Reda is tempted to fight his father's demands. On their pilgrimage, they meet an old woman (Ghina Ognianova) who ties to the two men and eventually has to be abandoned by Reda, a Turks Mustapha (Jacky Nercessian), who promises to lead the father-son duo, but instead causing a schism by drunk Reda in a pub and make her disappear, and countless frontier guards and customs agents delaying their progress for a variety of reasons. The tensions between father and son are rising: Reda can not understand the significance of this pilgrimage, which is so full of trials and mishaps, and the Father can not understand the insensibility of Reda to the religious beliefs and needs of the Father. At last they reach Mecca, where they are surrounded by pilgrims from all over the world and the importance of travel for Reda is overwhelming. The way the story approaches is touching and meaningful. It has undertaken a religious pilgrimage to restore the gap between youth and old age, between son and father, and between defiance and acceptance of religious values. <br /> <br /> The visual impact of this film is extraordinary - all the more so as it feels like the camera simply ""passes through"" to capture the beauty of the many stops along the way, without having to upgrade them with special effects. Nicolas Cazalé is a great actor (watch his latest movie ""The Grocer's Son"") and it's his carefully nuanced role that gives this film magic. Another beautiful movie from The Movie Movement, that's a tender story that's brilliantly narrated. Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> Grady harp"

In other films of that time, you would never see blacks integrated into a social scene, unless they were carriers in the train or maid in a big house. Here the blacks sit at the bar and sing with the others. I find it exciting, too, when the military dancer Roosevelt perform a ""card section"". There is also the NRA Eagle - the logo of the controversial National Recovery Administration's New Deal.

Jack and Nellie are married but their marriage is flat so she starts to look to Bob for comfort.,"Hitchcock shows his already developed understanding of visuals in this early silent movie. The plot of the film, in which two boxers argue about a girl, is a straightforward drama without much to recommend. However, Hitchcock's talent can be found in his stunning use of images. Almost every shot is filled with visual symbols. Especially noteworthy is the jewelry a boxer gives the girl just before she marries the other boxer. He puts it on her arm in a clearly sexual way and with a simple movement, Hitch has shown us everything we need to know. The boxing scenes are well-handled with some interesting point-of-view shots, once again proving how far Hitchcock was ahead of his time. The film also gives insight into his later treatment of women. The object of the wishes of the boxers is driven by money and lust, not by reason or love. The only other women in the movie are either pretty party girls offering open sex offerings or old women helping to break up happy relationships.

The movie was only 86 minutes long, and some of them were so bad that it was funny. Now for the low points. My first warning sign came with an actual ""warning"" on the movie. When it started, the following ""warning"" message was displayed: ""The movie you are going to see contains graphic and disturbing images, because contrary to popular belief, killing is neither funny nor pretty or romantic."" I should have saved the 86 minutes and then switched off. The first words of the film were: ""I'm in the glue factory."" It was a guy talking on his phone and he was referring to a nursing home as a glue factory. I do not know why. The basis of the film is that a child is obsessed with the Zodiac killer and begins to imitate him. The budget for this movie was at least $ 50 and they must have used the cheapest cameras they could find. The acting was worse than reading directly from a script. That's what they looked like. The script was awful, and the big ""twist"" was that this guy who wrote a biography of the Zodiac killer was actually the Zodiac killer. Of course, they tried to show this subtly, but made it completely obvious within the first 10 minutes. Without further painful details of the plot, here were some horrible highlights of the movie. They try to compare the Zodiac killer with an ""army of one"" because soldiers are really just killers. Then they tried to try ""Satanic Worship"" by showing some guys in black hoods in a meeting.

One of the stories is that this couple is unable to have sex because a series of disasters happen every time they want to. I seriously, is this story really necessary?

Another of the stories (which was probably the only story I was interested in) is based on the infidelity of a man and also ends in a lame, ancient sati-savitri pati-parmeshwar crap. I have no idea what the Salmaan Priyanka plot was about. There was no problem in the plot because it was a conspiracy. Can not take Karan Johar's film because she has to marry Salmaan? Why can not she marry him and still take the movie? Or do Advani and Priyanaka only want to prove to the world that it is indeed true that female actors can not be successful if they are married or are not to play in films after marriage? Of course, with six actors in the movie Advani can not produce the film alone. So he uses sponsors like the Times group, who shamelessly promote their Filmfare magazines. And also a jewelery brand, which the women in the movie seem to love! I come to IMDb to give him the worst rating, and I'm shocked to see contributions that praise the movie.

Mike's fear manifests itself in his inability to commit to his girlfriend of 4 1/2 years, Peg for fear that he will kill her too. Everything gets rolling when an ancient Indian totem wooden figure named Morty comes to life and starts killing off Mike's friends by making their worst fears come true. The ultimate confrontation comes when Mike has to face his greatest fear - his own father.","I did not see the first movie and if it does not have that, I do not feel like it. <br /> <br /> After watching it a few hours ago, I have trouble remembering something. <br /> <br /> From what I remember, the main plot seems to be a group of very annoying people who are sitting in a house with this dodgy old woman from Friday, the 13th, being chased by wooden board people , <br /> <br /> Some people die, the movie ends, I start a lawsuit against the person who sold me this movie as I want compensation for the missing time in my life. <br /> <br /> I'll pay you £ 1 to take this movie off my hands ... oh wait, I've already given it to a ""friend""."

Philip takes her back again when she returns with her baby. She wrecks his apartment and burns the securities he needs to pay tuition. He gets a job as a salesman, has surgery on his foot, receives an inheritance, and returns to school where he learns Mildred is dying.","When I saw that this movie was only 80 minutes long, I thought we were in trouble. Shutting down the gigantic W. Somerset Maugham novel to a movie that can be seen in less than an hour and a half seemed like a catastrophe waiting to happen. But you know, the movie is not half bad, and it even manages to withhold much of what makes the book resonate so much with its readers. <br /> <br /> I've heard many movie freaks complain that Leslie Howard was an actor's wet noodle, and he was, but I can not think of a more appropriate one to play the role of Philip Carey could be considered a wet noodle, because Carey is quite sure. Howard plays him well, which means you want to shake him and hit him repeatedly, then get him out and buy him a spine. <br /> <br /> Ah, and then there's Bette, as the girl with The Carey is obsessed and who's bringing his world down around him. I did not know what the charm of Mildred was in the book all over the world, and the film remains true to that detail. But as played by Davis, she becomes the most intriguing character in the story, and when she's evil and unlikable, she's the most dynamic person on the screen at all times. Davis's appearance here is associated with the change in the drama, as Brando's would have done almost 20 years later when he starred ""Stella !!"" playing in this little-known Tennesee Williams, and it's not hard to see why. Davis is intense to scare. She does not try to elicit sympathy from the audience, and she looks ugly and unglamorous. Her appearance, when Carey arrives too late in the movie to find her dead or nearly dead of an unnamed illness (though not much care is taken to hide the fact that it is an STD) is shocking. Of course it helps that the film squealed just before the production code came into effect; if it had been done a year later, you could bet things would have been a little different. <br /> <br /> Yes, much of the novel and many of its most interesting parts have stayed on the floor of the cutting room and the story is really about Carey and Mildred and not much else. I found this to be the least interesting and boring part of Maugham's novel, but it is the part that gives the novel its title, and seems to be the part that readers are still attracted to as part of the filmmakers, that they have decided to adapt the novel as they did. <br /> <br /> Note: B +"

He is less delighted when her ...","I just read a book about Anita Loos' work and the photo in MacDonald's TCM Magazine in her angelic costume looked great (impressive wings), so I thought I was going to watch this movie. I had never heard of the movie before, so I had no preconceived notions about it. I thought it would have made a nice start with Eddy as a playboy and MacDonald as a secretary he does not know exists. The scene in which she shows up at the costume party in her simple angel costume with an uncooperative halo and wings that do not stay was really adorable. I even went to the movie when Eddy went to sleep and imagine her as a real angel. But after a while, it started to crumble for me. Eddy stays ""asleep"" for the rest of the movie, so it's all a dream. Whatever happens from then on does not matter because he just dreams. The rest was pretty plain and pointless. I had to force myself to stick to it. And the last number, in which MacDonald changes in a crazy hallucination of the music number to the music number, was simply crazy. <br /> <br /> Did Eddy ""wake up"" earlier and the original story went on, or did he really marry an angel? I think it would have been a lot more interesting. I wanted to see more of her true character. <br /> <br /> There were not really enough musical numbers to call it a musical. The first few songs were good, but the jitterbug that MacDonald plays was like nails on a blackboard. Totally wrong for her opera voice. Nevertheless, Eddy and MacDonald still shine and show what true stars are."
3,tt0092677,0,"While working in a greenhouse, a man receives an insect bite after touching an exotic plant. Immediately, he falls ill and is taken to an emergency room where the doctors diagnose him as suffering from an unknown bacteria, and a strange parasite which emerges from his mouth as a large slimy wormlike creature. Soon, there are more cases of bacterial infection, but the more immediate problem for the hospital is the wormlike creature which after accidental exposure to a genetic growth stimulant grows to monstrous proportions and starts a reign of terror and bloodshed in the hospitals abandoned wing.","This movie is a mess, but at least not pretentious. The boxing art for the video markets it as a ""fun flashback"" to the huge 1950s bug movies. In fact, it is a transparent bargain rip-off of ""aliens"". <br /> <br /> The producers clearly wanted to make an ""ALIEN"" picture, but they probably did not have much money. In fact, it does not look like they really have any money. I hope everyone who has worked on this thing has been paid. <br /> <br /> Maintaining the groundwork - a group of people isolated with a murderous insectoid creature - and an earthbound place being inserted for budgetary reasons, I suppose. Instead of putting the film in the room where nobody can hear you screaming, they put the movie in a hospital where everyone can expose their budget. The amusing thing about ""Blue Monkey"" (and only one thing is amusing) is that the filmmakers did not abandon the ""ALIEN"" aesthetic. Although we are in a hospital, we still have an unlikely cavernous appendix where science fiction experiments are performed, in this case the venerable ""growth hormone"" plumbing device. The appendix also serves as a boiler room (or so), so we can get an explanation for the monster that seeks the heat. The boiler room is so large that it is clad with multi-level steel walkways, perfect to let slime drip between the slats. <br /> <br /> The idea is that a man who works in a greenhouse is being attacked by a hanging flower from a rare imported plant that grows in an exotic location. He touches it and says ""Ow,"" so we know he was hurt. The cut on his finger causes him to sink into unconsciousness within a few minutes, and in the hospital he gives birth to a white worm through his mouth (I assume that in an ""ALIEN"" image, this would be called the ""oral lover""? ). The worm is isolated, but some naughty little children (leukemia patients) sneak up on it and ""randomly"" give an experimental growth hormone. They know that everyone is in trouble when some unsportsmanlike hospital workers are attacked by a camera on a crane, and pretty soon a maintenance man finds some compulsory cocoons just before being grabbed by a pair of semi-convincing insectoid arms. The rest of the movie is dominated by the half-offscreen monster, half hidden in the semi-darkness. <br /> <br /> What brings us back to ""ALIEN"". How can you ask if a movie in a hospital can record all the flashing strobe lights that are always in the ""ALIEN"" movies? No problem ... a power outage (or something else) causes the electrical system to go awry, which obviously causes flashing lights in every room in the hospital and flickering throughout the movie. This also serves as a comfortable coat for the less than special effects (though the bugs look pretty neat, they do not move so well, and the baby bug looks charming like a cootie toy). <br /> <br /> OK, so what ""ALIEN"" bases we did not cover ... OH, water was dripping on the walls! Check ... we'll divide the huge hospital into two and then send some of the characters through the dank, drippy basement to get to the other side. Problem solved, we now have the option of numerous ""Sham Tunnel"" shots. And do not forget the fog ... well, in horror movies you never need an excuse, right? OK, maybe in a hospital you do, so we'll smoke by lighting and burning a lot of things. <br /> <br /> I have not said anything about the negligible spectacle, not that the actors are given any kind of script to follow. I suppose ""Blue Monkey"" should be carefree and fun, and if so, then it's a nice try, but the pieces do not come together and the movie becomes a real dilemma. See a movie titled ""Return of the Aliens: The Deadly Spawn"" if you want to see a movie of this type that does it right, with even less money and even marginal acting skills. This falls flat on his ALIEN."

However, older children can eat it up, that is, if you play it in English. <br /> <br /> The story is that of a little boy who moved in with his mother to live with his grandfather after a divorce. During a village festival, the boy is chosen as the ""Kirin Rider"", a great honor, but with that honor comes, of course, much danger and adventure. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, evil acts as a woman's hand in a white miniskirt, go-go boots and a hive hairstyle, team with a wicked yokai to counter the resentment and discarded objects of humans against her turn.

The look and feel of the movie is great, the effects are entertaining, and some of the humor will just sail over kids' heads, but still older people will like it. As for adults, there is not much to like here, if you are a fan of Japanese monster movies, enjoy hell. <br /> <br /> Cool & funny stuff, sometimes a bit dark, but maybe that's just Miike ... and what a wild ride. 8 out of 10 points."

But fate takes a strange turn when she meets her killer and the two fall in love. Of course, Nancy realizes that love and murder do not naturally go hand in hand.","As is often the case, films about self-deprecating characters usually do not provide good drama. ""Download Nancy"" is no exception. It is supposedly based on a true story about a woman being murdered at her own request by someone she encounters over the Internet. <br /> <br /> The protagonist is Nancy (Maria Bello), who is married to Albert (Rufus Sewell). Albert is a successful software developer who has developed a golf game that has successfully marketed his business to various bars and bars / restaurants. Unlike most people, Albert has virtually no positive qualities (apart from his ability to succeed in the business world). Throughout the film, Albert has a grim and sullen expression on his face. He has no sympathy for his wife with all her emotional problems and resorts to upcoming prostitutes. When his wife asks about sex, he punishes her by masturbating in her presence instead. <br /> <br /> Nancy is as much a character as a person. Not only did she have a loveless 15-year marriage, but she was also sexually abused by her uncle when she grew up (fortunately, there are no flashbacks from this back story in the movie). Her self-loathing takes the form of self-mutilation and causes her to be forced into therapy. However, she has such contempt for her therapist that no progress can be made. <br /> <br /> Finally Nancy is so depressed that she contacts Louis via the internet. He is a kind of sadomasochistic gigolo who has sex with women to earn money while causing large amounts of pain. It turns out that Louis has two children, but he does not see them anymore (the children's mother does not want to have anything to do with him anymore). <br /> <br /> Nancy's plan is to have painful sex with Louis first and then have him killed. There is a particularly unpleasant scene in which Louis has sex with Nancy while she cuts her vaginal area with a broken piece of glass. These scenes are shown as flashbacks after Louis visits Albert, who captivates him and hits him with a golf club. It seems Louis has a twofold plan to see Albert: 1) berate him for his treatment of Nancy and 2) enjoy the blows he receives. It takes a while for Louis to reveal Nancy's fate. First, he forces Albert to do him the favor of bringing his dog to a relative for someone to take care of in the future. Of course, Nancy's fate is that Louis eventually suffocated her to death (but he did not hesitate until he made it clear that he had some ""feelings"" for her). We soon learn that Louis is imprisoned for life for Nancy's murder. <br /> <br /> What exactly do we have to take away from a movie like Downloading Nancy? Should we regret victims of sexual abuse and domestic violence? Is that the main point of the movie? Is sympathy for Nancy actually justified? I do not think so. The authors of the film create a straw man in the guise of Albert - someone so cut off from his feelings that he is the one to blame for Nancy's decay. But are people so one-dimensional in real life? I do not think so. You've come across the repugnant Louis, a man who is making a living from causing pain, and accusing Albert of neglecting Nancy. In addition, his love for Nancy (before he kills her) should show his ""sensitive side"". <br /> <br /> In the end it does not matter if the filmmakers have defined where their sympathies lie the different characters in the movie. They are so anxious to tickle their audience with scenes of unnecessary violence that Downloading Nancy is nothing but an exercise in bad taste and gentle pornography."

While the film is filmed nicely, it is by no means subtle or grand or what the reviewer used for other hypobolic descriptions. <br /> <br /> ""Art of Revenge"" is a fair movie, but it's a big tease. It offers all sorts of sexual situations, but never gets away with it. Like a skin patch on Cinemax, but with all the ""naughty bits"" cut out. <br /> <br /> The movie as a whole is a bit unfocused and the end and much of the third act is really a big mess.

I think many so-called action movies have copied many ""escape scenes"" from this movie !! And it not only impresses me when I see such copies, it always enhances my appreciation for this masterpiece! :) The main actors did a wonderful job. The slow and realistic development of the chemistry of the heroine and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed. As children, we felt that the love they developed b / w was very natural. The way they coped with all their trials and tribulations together was something that even made children realize the value of true love, sacrifice, and care.

But Pope Kiril I must now deal with his own self-doubt, the struggle of his friend Father Telemond, who is under scrutiny for his beliefs, and find a solution to the crisis in China.","I saw this whole (very long) movie because I was fascinated by sheer stupidity and naivety. It seems hard to believe that so many famous people (Anthony Quinn, Lawrence Olivier, John Gielguld, Vittorio de Sica, etc.) willingly participated in this farce. But maybe in 1968 people were really so naive? The story seems to have been written by a confused Latin American Marxist priest with an agenda. There is a superpower conflict and the Russians are actually the good guys, and the Secretary General of the Communist Party is a nice and spiritual man who suddenly sees the light after 20 years and has to calm his guilty conscience by releasing a prisoner priest from a Siberian gulag. The priest then promptly becomes a pope by a series of coincidences. We are allowed to see the secret Vatican papal election process, presented in the most pious form you can imagine. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the communists in China have reached the usual socialist economic miracle of the starving half of their country to death. To solve this little hiccup on the relentlessly shining path to communism, they want to start a nuclear war (to distribute the western capitalist riches rightly to the poor workers of China). <br /> <br /> Our good old Comrade General Secretary gets a bit worried and calls on the Pope shortly before his coronation to ask him to mediate peace. They meet with Chinese leader comrade Peng, who looks and behaves like a 15-year-old boy. They will roll to the ground and laugh at how the Chinese believed the Chinese in 1968. Comrade Peng demands that Western capitalists pay (which is perfectly logical, capitalists do not always have to pay for the insanity of the Socialists?), And that the Pope must also sacrifice something for the common altruistic cause of equality and social justice. <br /> <br /> When the Pope is crowned in Rome, he promises all the wealth of the Catholic Church worldwide to feed our poor Chinese brothers in Christ. And so he saves the world from the nuclear holocaust. <br /> <br /> Apart from that, there are also some smaller sub-plots that, unfortunately, do little to redeem this incredibly bad movie. I would give it three Oscars for stupidity. <br /> <br /> By the way, Anthony Quinn seems unlikely as Pope. He is much more plausible than Zorba the Greek."

The werewolf effects are usually kept in the dark - for a good reason! They are terrible when you see them. Below average special effects too - though I liked the cartoon flash coming from Danning's fingers. There is also a werewolf orgy that is especially stupid and Danning takes at least EIGHT TIMES during the credits! <br /> <br /> There are a few good things - I found the village in Transylvania amusing - it looks like it's from a 1930s Universal horror movie! There are interesting camera ticks between transitional scenes; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good at it - but they can not save it. Really - WHY did you do that? Where do you hard for money ??? This is one of the least rated movies by IMDb. That alone should tell you something. Supposedly Danning was horrified when she saw the movie - I understand why! A must."

The brother is a military General, and is out of touch with toymaking, and out of touch with reality too. The business should really have been given to Leslie, who was much more like his toymaking father. When the General starts making weapons instead of toys, Leslie decides to take action.","You will receive a gift. It is exquisitely packed. The box is handmade from the finest wood and shows skill down to the smallest detail. This is then wrapped in beautiful paper, handcrafted and hand-painted by the most talented artists. The whole thing is wrapped in ribbons of fine silk lace. It is an unforgettable sight. <br /> <br /> Then you cut the ribbon, take off the paper, open the box and find ... nothing. This is toys. Either you enjoy the packaging or forget it. <br /> <br /> The movie is not without meaning: war is not a good thing. Well, that is not original! The moral is so obvious that it is almost embarrassing to point it out. And even this faint insight is undermined by a story in which elements of war - especially war toys - are clearly a bad thing until they need an exciting climax and the movie simulates a war with innocent toys. It's like someone preaching a serious, condescending sermon just to say, ""Just kidding."" <br /> <br /> But even as an empty box, the film can not be watched closely. Yes, it is a sight with some remarkable, eye-catching pictures. The sets are imaginative and the cinematography captures the colorful scenes with skill. But the pictures are cold and emotionally sterile. As with the script, the look of the film is joyless and sometimes aesthetically unfruitful and surreal. It is a film that wants to praise toys as a wonderful and special thing, and yet shows that they are creations of a world that is empty and cold. The movie wants to be sullenly funny, but the humor is forced and artificial. Robin Williams, the beleaguered heir of a toy-making empire, throws his ad-lib shtick, who seems alien to the bizarre, cold-structured world he inhabits. In fact, the thematic references and tasteless sexual allusions that are scattered throughout are contradictory to the childish fable that the film attempts to be vague. For this movie to work or make sense, it must be located in its own universe, Oz, far from Kansas. Every time the jokes push us back to reality, the toy land of the movie increasingly becomes an obvious illusion. <br /> <br /> It is said that this was the favorite project of director Barry Levinson, one he was aiming for for ten years. It's very obvious why he had trouble getting support. Like most animal projects that are eventually made (RADIOLAND MURDERS, RADIO FLYER & BATTLEFIELD: EARTH are great examples), it seems to be a blind spot in the filmmaker's field of vision. Maybe Levinson TOYS steered and directed so many times in his head that he did not get a new vision for it when he finally got on stage. He had already perfected it to death. <br /> <br /> Many of the toys shown in the movie are clumsy, mechanical, catching monstrosities. That's the movie itself."

While Jack slowly gets more violent and angry of his life, his son, Danny, tries to use a special talent, the ""Shining"", to inform the people outside about whatever that is going on in the hotel.","The Shining, do you know what's funny about this movie? This is the movie everyone for people who claim to dislike horror movies always say that The Shining is a terrific movie. This is Stanley Kubrick's classic vision of Stephen King's horror story of Madness and Blood. This is just an incredible movie and you've seen it or not, you've heard of it, know a few lines and know some of the classic pictures. Who could Jack's ""Here's Johnny!"" To forget? Who could forget ""All Work and No Play Making Jack a Dull Boy""? Who could forget this frosty end? This is the movie that is memorable and, in my opinion, Kubrick's best work. I know that there is a lot of controversy in this department, a lot of people say it is 2001: Space Odyssey or Clockwork Orange or even Dr. Strange, but if this film pioneered film production, then The Shining perfected it. This is the story of isolation, madness, terrible imagery and the ultimate ghost story that will crawl under your skin. <br /> <br /> Jack Torrance, Jack's son Danny and Jack's wife Wendy arrive at Overlook Hotel on the closing day. The older African American cook Dick Hallorann surprises Danny by telepathically speaking to him and offering him an ice cream. He tells Danny that he and his grandmother shared the gift; they called the communication ""shiny"". Danny asks if there is anything to fear in the hotel, especially in room 237. Dick tells Danny that the hotel has a certain ""shine"" and many memories, not all good, and advises him to stay out of the room all circumstances. Danny's curiosity about Room 237 finally comes over him when he sees that the room has been opened. Danny is hurt and visibly traumatized after Jack tells Wendy that he loves his family. Wendy thinks that Jack has abused Danny. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room, where he meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd. Danny starts frantically calling the word ""Redrum"" and scribbles it on the walls. He goes into a trance and withdraws; he now says that he is Tony, his own ""imaginary friend"". Jack sabotages the hotel radio and interrupts communication from the outside world, but Hallorann has received Danny's telepathic call for help and is on his way. Wendy discovers that Jack has written endless pages of the manuscript in which he repeats ""All work and no game makes Jack a dull boy"", which are formatted in several ways. Terrified Jack threatens her and she knocked him unconscious with a baseball bat and locks him in a pantry in the kitchen. Jack talks to Grady through the locker door, which then releases and releases it. Danny wrote ""REDRUM"" in lipstick on the door of Wendy's bedroom. As she looks in the mirror, she sees that ""Murder"" is written backwards. Jack picks up an ax and starts hacking through the door that leads to his family's living quarters. ""Here's Johnny!"", And Jack's legendary image is born. <br /> <br /> The Shining is one of those films that you have to look at seriously, this is an incredible movie and still gives me nightmares. Jack Nicholson's performance is timeless and unforgettable. But one thing I also feel is extremely overlooked is Shelley Duvall, her scene, finding Jack's swear word All Work? It's unbelievable, it's a horror expression and you can see that fear in her face after realizing that her husband is crazy. Another unbelievable scene is when Jack sees a ghost woman in the bath, it's one of the dreadest scenes in the horror movie theater. The reason this movie is so well-known is that it's a film of perfection, it was on the Simpsons, it was shown in other films and it's a movie that will stay with you forever when you see it , trust me. <br /> <br /> 10/10"

Rather, it shows a young pig with an appetite more insatiable than John Belushi's ""Animal House"". His mother scolds him repeatedly, but it does not do well. So much so that he goes to another house where a deranged scientist nourishes him more than any ordinary mortal (but in the end there is a surprise). <br /> <br /> I would say this cartoon looked like a placeholder between the really great cartoons (Daffy Duck made his debut three months after the show). But do not make mistakes, they are doing some nice things here. The whole force-feeding sequence seems to be more relevant today, given the obesity epidemic that is overtaking our country. <br /> <br /> Not the best cartoon, but worth seeing."

He hates Christmas, only cares about making money and only gives his clerk, Bob Cratchit, the day off. However, he is taught the true meaning and spirit of Christmas by three ghosts who show him his own past and present. He is also shown what the future holds for him after his death if he doesn't change his behavior for the better.","and possibly closest to the story of Dickens. Although I find the young Ebenezer hard to see (who thinks the hair of the period, surely they could have done better!), Scott does an incredible job as Scrooge. His delivery of a few lines from Dickens eventually brought it to life for me. Edward Woodward is everything we expect and more of the spirit of the Christmas present. I find G.C. Scott's Scrooge is much more of a credible miser than the more recent version of Patrick Stewart. The scene Christmas morning, when Scrooge realizes that he has not ""missed"" it, is enough to convince one that Scott knows how to act against transposition. He is phenomenal here. Almost the entire cast is incredible. Little Tim in this version of The Christmas Carol is a bit hard to see, almost too cute. Nevertheless, the music and the landscape is a must for every holiday. Enjoy!"

His only chance of rescue seems to be the war veteran Haglund who is a leader of a special taskforce.","The words ""Swedish"" and ""action movie"" do not mix. This becomes more and more obvious with every attempt of the genre. This is another failed attempt. <br /> <br /> Lasse Brunell (Shanti Roney) works at a military airfield with top-secret computer systems. One day foreign criminals threaten to hurt his family if he does not do as they say. They want the secret equipment and will do anything to get it. <br /> <br /> This movie has its ups and downs. And there are usually no ""ups"" in Swedish action movies, just downs. So I think something in this movie showed some quality. At the beginning of the positive comments I can mention that the film is technically well done. The images of planes and helicopters are well shot and look very good. The spectacle is of very different quality. Shanti Roney does a decent job, while Maria Bonnevie is as always stiff and unnatural (I wonder how long Swedish directors will continue to use her, even though she has the acting skills of a wooden plank?). Stefan Sauk is laughable as the ""cool"" special-force man who comes to the base to investigate. <br /> <br /> And what about the action scenes? Well, as I said above, the air and helicopter flights are nice. But apart from that there is not much to talk about. And that's a common problem with Swedish action movies. There just is not enough action. Maybe it's a budget problem, maybe it's movie culture. I do not know, but it negatively affects the experience. Because honestly, the story and the drama are not good enough for this movie to rely on. <br /> <br /> I rate this 4/10 as an expense."

It's certainly a well done and competent movie, but it's clear that the bulk of the success lies on the shoulders of Daniel Day-Lewis, who takes on the role of Cristian Brown, a man with cerebral palsy. Day-Lewis pulls off the same stunt show that Dustin Hoffman had earned an Oscar the year before for playing a man with autism in ""Rain Man"", and the Academy followed Day-Lewis with the same honors. > <br /> The only thing that separates this movie from a big Hollywood production is just that - its budget.

The heavy dependence on boring dialogues and cheesy movements should be expected, as well as the primitiveness (or absence) of special effects in those days.

9,tt0034778,1,"Because boxing is a considered an illegal and disreputable enterprise in 1880's San Francisco, wealthy and influential members of the prestigious Olympic Club vow to make the sport a ""gentlemanly"" one. They sponsor a brash, extroverted young bank clerk named Jim Corbett, who quickly becomes an accomplished fighter under the new Marquis of Queensbury Rules. Despite his success, the young Irish-American's social pretensions and boastful manner soon estrange him from his benefactors, who plot to give their conceited former protégé a well-deserved comeuppance. Despite this, his dazzlingly innovative footwork helps him to beat a succession of bigger and stronger men, and he finally finds himself fighting for the world's championship against his childhood idol, John L. Sullivan.","Detached from James J Corbett's biography ""The Roar Of The Crowd,"" Gentleman Jim is a wonderfully airy image that epitomized not only the rise of the pugilistic whistle-blower Corbett, but also the wind of change in boxing around the 1890s. <br /> <br /> The story follows Corbett (a perfectly casted Errol Flynn) from his humble beginnings as a bank clerk in San Fransico, to a fortuitous fight with an ex-boxing champion, who eventually leads him to fight against the fearsome heavyweight champion, John L Sullivan {Beefcake, personified by Ward Bond}. Not all fights are in the ring tho, and it's all the spin-off vignettes in Corbett's life that make this a great entertaining image. There are class problems that need to be overcome here (played perfectly by other club members who are paid to have one or two hooks), and Corbett not only has to fight to get respect from his so-called peers but he has to also overcome his ego as it grows as fast as its reputation. Along with the rather wonderful Corbett family and all their stoic, humorous support, Corbett's journey is as thrilling as it is joyous, yet as outrageous and daring as he is, he is a very likable character, and it is a character who stands for the buzzword suitable moniker he has from gentleman Jim. <br /> <br /> The movie does not stop for a moment, and it's a testament to director Raoul Walsh that even though we're waiting anxiously for the final fight, the outer ring keeps us entertained, not even the love interest sub Action violates this picture {thanks Alexis Smith}. The combat sequences are really good, and they perfectly show how Corbett became champion. His brand of dance rings around rackets is now firmly anchored in the boxing history. As the final roles roll, we all come down to earth because a match-up meeting between Sullivan and Corbett brings all the brutality into context, and here humility and modesty become the absolute winners and as far as that onlooker goes .... ........ I'm sure, 9/10 for a really wonderful picture."
7,tt0084931,1,"A famous opera singer, Giorgio Fini, loses his voice during an American tour. He goes to a female throat specialist, Pamela Taylor, whom he falls in love with.","Some time ago, there were different types of films. These different films co-existed, although everyone had something else to offer ... <br /> <br /> That may seem obvious at first, but I thought I would point it out during this review because it looks like if some people might have forgotten it. This is just a funny movie for Pavarotti fans. That's all. It does not claim to be something different or something bigger. People who mock it as something that lags behind a promise, do not see the whole picture - literally. After all, Hollywood is always making films that are shameless vehicles for people (bodyguard or The Preacher's Wife with Whitney Houston are two examples that come to mind.) First, I want the movie as a vehicle for Pavarotti. There are worse things in this world - and worse movies. The vocals are fabulous and the selection of arias is fun. The film begins with Schubert's Ave Maria and then Leoncavallo's Matinatta. Pav sings arias from La Gioconda, Manon Lescaut and Turandot, but also sings popular music such as ""I left my heart in San Francisco"" and the song that was nominated for an Oscar and Golden Globe ""When we were in love"" w / music by John Williams & lyrics by Alan & Marilyn Bergman - all 3 previous Oscar winners. <br /> <br /> The story is not that bad. It was built for Pavarotti, so of course it will not be something profound or universal for the average viewer. It is the story of a famous opera singer who was traumatized years ago by a bad opera night. When he is asked to sing again in the same place, the ""MET"" in New York, he loses his voice out of fear. Doctor Pamela (or Pah-MAI-lah in Italian :)), played by Kathryn Harrold, gives him a chance to heal his psychosomatic response. He offers her the chance to have an affair with him, and she reluctantly accepts. <br /> <br /> They start an affair, they know that he is married and promises not to fall in love with him and he thinks she will be just another woman. In spite of everything, they fall in love (the song ""IF we're in love"") and with their help, he overcomes his fear and goes back to the MET, where he triumphs. I will not say how it ends, but it's pretty predictable. Which is not always bad. <br /> <br /> The services are not that bad. Pavarotti (who plays Giorgio Fini) is not an actor, so if you're expecting a performance by Spencer Tracy or Tom Hanks, you're being fooled, not Pavarotti. He knows that he is not a theater player. What he is is sweet, charming and charismatic. He's having fun himself, and if you can just have fun, it's not so bad. A funny line is when he tells Pamela (Harrold) that she's a ""thirsty plant, Fini can pour you!"" and of course she says, ""I do not want to be watered by Fini!"" Kathryn Harrold is very sweet and does a good job as a half-jammed woman learning to live a little from this extravagant man. One of my favorite lines in the movie is, ""Life never has to be life-size."" And there's Eddie Albert doing his good job as finis manager. There are several ""yourself"" cameos of real conductors, singers etc and it is filmed on site at the Metropolitan Opera at the Lincoln Center. <br /> <br /> If you like opera, if you like Pavarotti, or if you just let yourself go and enjoy a ""little fling"", as he suggests in the movie - then you can enjoy this movie for that , I know, I do it EVERY time. :) <br /> <br />"

Of course, in this updated version, we get tons of CGI ghosts that make the film completely unscientific (given the weak script / plot). The f / x are not even that great, considering they were made by ILM. The frozen breath looks particularly wrong. The effects in the underrated Peter Jackson movie ""The Frighteners"", which I have just seen, were much better. The wood carvings of the kids, who are supposed to look scary, just look silly (especially when they scream), and the CGI monsters are nothing to write home about. Instead of offering a relief from bad acting, bad direction and bad writing, the effects only add to that confusion of a movie. <br /> <br /> Some particularly stupid scenes: When the three other characters break into Eleanor's bedroom and none of them seems to be surprised to find a huge, sinister demon hovering over the bed. The scene in which Eleanor ""sees"" the former mistress of the rafters is particularly theatrical. And last but not least, the unintentionally hilarious piece in which Wooden Blond Guy utters an uninspired scream of what is to be perceived as fear jumps onto a piece of furniture and begins to hack the image of the old, bad boy's house. We actually have some satisfaction in this scene. Seconds after his assault, Blond Guy is dragged to the fireplace by the old man's ghost and immediately gets his head cut off. It was the only part of the movie I enjoyed. <br /> <br /> In summary, stay with the original 1963 ""The Haunting"". 3/10 stars."

But when a fire starts on the French side, the general decency of the German men leads to help, security and even friendship. This was a request that would fall on deaf ears within the decade, as a certain man of Pabst's own side would break this piece and make the First World War a mere prelude. But it is obvious to me that Pabst really believes, or at least hopes, for this fundamental humanism, since this film radiates with this optimism, while his rather frivolous, cynical adaptation of the Threepenny Opera did not have the necessary bite to make this work work. His sincere belief is the fact that the characters here are not simplistic mouthpieces for positions, but real people, with real families whose lives we also know at home.

2,tt0104515,0,"A famous surgeon gets into a coma after a car accident. Seven years later, he wakes up as a mutilated monster and starts a massacre.","This infamous end of Koen Wauters' career became known to me through the 'Night of Bad Taste'. Judging by the commentary index, I was not the first and I'm not the last person in Western Europe who learns that this musician (no doubt one of the best in our contemporary pop scene, even the Dutch agree) is trying to be an actor , Whether he should have made the attempt or not can not be judged. <br /> <br /> In 'Intensive Care' he is quite sympathetic, but he seems to be uncomfortable with the band he is attending. Nobody can blame him. It deserves its ranking in Verheyen's Hall of Fame by all means and standards. The story of the murderous maniac, who is said to have died in an accident but is alive and wrathful, has been told dozens of times, and even without original twists, a director can provide a more than mediocre story through innovative settings and cinematography /> <br / > IC teamed with a hospital wing and a few middle class homes. The tempo is boring. The suspense lightens the credibility of the score, as each occurrence of the killer is accompanied by a boring, threatening melody, followed by orchestral outbursts during the murders, which are widely proposed and at least as bloodless as a small budget , The sex scene is free, but not in the least appealing. The couple from Amsterdamned could have done it though. When dealing with the couple theme: the whole subplot between Wauters and the girl does not work. A more effective emotional connection could have been established on the screen if it were only for future fellow human beings relaxing their nerves halfway through physical intercourse. I will not even give the other performers the dignity of a mention, for they should all have been broken up into tiny greasy pieces. In fact, most of them do. The ones I remember were obvious to the genre: a pretty nurse and two policemen. <br /> <br /> Therefore, the cavalry in a slasher only comes in time to save itself. The (anti-) hero usually has to eliminate the villain by skillful thinking, because former red caps often have no roles in these films; They could overcome the illusion of invincibility surrounding the killer. Translated to the events, Wauters kills the doctor and rescues the lady in distress. <br /> <br /> No people, I'm not done. That's not the story. Wauters makes his heroic attempt, but is beaten with a rage that comes close to ""A Clockwork Orange,"" so it's up to the girl to pick up the drill-killer act and sting through the doctors' brains. Although this method ensures the death of the killer more than the usual 9mm bullets, the physician survives so that IC can reach the 80-minute mark. <br /> <br /> I should have clarified my point now. Intensive Care is a bad movie that can only be enjoyed by Bad Taste lovers who can verify Vereyen's catchy statements and take care of themselves, thus trying to assert themselves. For example, the (unintentional) parody value of the doctor's clown mask (Halloween) and the final confrontation in the park (the chase at the end of the 13th Friday). <br /> <br /> But let me conclude by giving an overview through some seedy items that give IC a bit of credit. George Kennedy is not one of them. All he has to do is bear a terrible monologue of a doctor / French actor and watch in horror as they burn him to mark his great name on a substitute. He could have played his naked gun part again, eventually ending up as a beef, but with a longer screen time. The final could be one of them. I had never seen a madman brought into his bowels by fireworks to crush him against a flexible fence. It's good for a laugh. <br /> <br /> Call a good point about intensive care ... Koen Wauters has learned his lesson and devoted himself entirely to his musical career. I wonder how many issues of the race in Paris-Dakar he must break off before he comes to his senses. <br /> <br />"

But it was more than just what it was, and I can not deny that I enjoyed it so much. <br /> <br /> ""Azumi 2"" lacks almost everything that made the original so wonderful. The first thing that sounds the alarm bells is the absence of the great Ryuhei Kitamura at the helm. With him, he not only seemed to take on his own visual flair and kinetics, but also the original style, the beauty, and above all, his heart. While the first one had a simple ""hit list"" storyline, this one has a corkscrew mess of a story, with too many dull characters biting each other in the back as often as the potential for any sympathy or pathos is erased. Gone is the effective interaction of the main characters; Azumi and her cohorts are often reduced to a group of scruffy teenagers arguing in a forest. Characterization is nonexistent; If someone really cares who lives and who dies, I will be shocked. The same applies to the rogues here. The final battle - indeed all battles - is completely tension-free. The fact that they are badly choreographed and abysmally directed - not to mention a few and far away - becomes a minor matter by their own sheer futility. The rogues themselves are trying too hard to camp, and even when they're all together, they do not come in a mile of the original Pete Burnsian antics of Jo Odagiri. <br /> <br /> ## Major spoilers at the end of the paragraph! ##### <br /> <br /> Aya Ueto tries her best, but she also managed to keep her hair in good condition between films.

I know that's the point, but combined with the ineffectiveness of everyone else in the movie, the stupidity of the plot, and the general incompetence of the movie in general, it means it's impossible to get behind your character this time.

One can imagine that the director wants to reduce the first strong sensual feelings of the girls to the lesbian, but even in this case, they do not falsify the likelihood of the story.

Job and his men are on their way to conquering a metropolitan city, while Nea (with revenge in mind) asks Gabriel to train her in the way of killing cyborgs, and she will take him to Gabriel. <br /> <br /> The cheap low-rent cyborg / post-apocalyptic foray by writer and director Albert Pyun (who previously made ""cyborg"" and the glowing ""nemsis"" in the same year) is a rather misguided chunk with some interesting news. Very little structure finds its way into the threadbare history, since the swollen writing is weak, cheesy and exaggerated. The leaden banter tries to be funny, but it stinks pretty and looks funny in the unwanted moments. Most of the actions that occur are pretty pointless and routine. The material could have used a different polish as it was an inspired idea devoured by lazy inclusions, the lack of a narrative, and an almost jokey tone. The open-end cliffhanger graduation is just too abrupt, especially since a sequel has not yet been made. Feels like it has no more money and said, ""Time to pack, let's end it another day (or maybe another decade), there's no hurry."" But it was quite entertaining, especially thanks to its fast pace, some well done fights, and George Mooradian's sliding cinematography, which captured the visually compelling scenery. Performances are fair. Kris Kristofferson's dry and steely personality works perfectly like Gabriel, and a confident, psychic-minded Kathy Long expertly and aggressively stuns the stunts. Her acting is too wooden. A Raided Lance Henriksen gives a delicious performance of pure ham, like the rogue cyborg leader Job, who constantly has a saliva melt. Scott Paulin also drums up a lot of happiness as one of the cyborgs and Gary Daniels pouts as well. Pyun suggests some exciting martial arts set pieces that feature eye-catching power and unnecessary slow motion. Facing the background is a burning but mechanically sounding music.

In early 2003 appeared ""Dahmer"", a blunt, boring, badly played and virtually bloodless snorer party of a crime drama that never really dives into the monstrous and insane psyche of the late mass murderer as if it had the perfectly good potential! However, what it does for reasons unknown to me is a sort of sympathy for the man, portraying him as a lonely, nebbishy, ​​and severely socially incompetent homosexual loser, simply for love in all the wrong places as opposed to the cold, calculating and spoiled sicko and madman, who he was! All in all, 2003's ""Dahmer"" is one thing that true crime fanatics can skip everywhere, because I'm not joking when I say it's one of the worst serial killer biopics ever made!

It seems that in 1990 Hooper wanted to make his own version of films like Scanners and Firestarter, and so we end up with Spontaneous Combustion; A movie with some good ideas and a whole load more borrowed from other films.

The turbulent direction and the boring writing also do not do much for the film, and the trend of lacking in favors continues through the special effects, which are very unrealistic and have nothing to do with the films this film breaks off; all made a few years ago. The plot is very slow and it's almost an hour before something remarkable happened, and that did not bother me at the time. It soon becomes clear which direction the movie will go, and it all boils down to the boring ending that one would expect. The last confrontation is a big disappointment and nothing is really explained during the movie. Not that any revelation was any interesting.

But apart from that, there's almost nothing worth mentioning about THE INCUBUS except it's unintentionally funny."

But unlike Trainspotting and Acid House without a good dose of humor or gritty realism, movies like these do not work. More importantly, without a decent script, a movie will not work and there's nothing new, inspiring, or thought-provoking about the script for this film. <br /> <br /> The fact that this movie has won a few Baftas shows how bad the British film industry is at the moment.

I have already seen some movies that look so good. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow use eye-catching cinematography, computer graphics and creative futuristic designs to create a world that's historically familiar yet something new. The period seems to be in the 1930s or early 40s. The film tells of recent attacks on New York City by mechanized armies stealing generators and the like for some inexplicable reason. The mysterious disappearance of relevant scientific heads coincides. Who can stop them and save the world? Okay, it takes no leap of faith to know that it's the Sky Captain himself, his witty reporter friend who's always hot for a trail, and his wings, his faithful, thoroughly competent buddy. What Sky Captain has in terms of atmosphere and graphics lacks storytelling and characterization. The plot for this movie is ridiculous. That is, the film is for a serial feeling of film series of yesterday. They had pretty far away stories and bad acting - but none of them, and I mean none of them, had the budget and the big names this movie had. Two award-winning actors and Jude Law could hold a movie afloat, one would think, but Sky Captain sinks miserably. Despite the fantastic dark look, I wish the film would just end and I could go on with my life. I had little interest in a story that aroused little interest. I was not at all interested in any of the glittering presentations. Paltrow was just terrible. Jolie was a joke with a role that had virtually no substance. The law can not carry the one-stranded tradition too much on its limited shoulders. I mean, let's face it, he's not Will Smith, Mel Gibson or even Wesley Snipes. The sad thing about Sky Captain, at least for me, was that it was so promising and yet delivered so little. I was bored ten minutes after the movie - waiting for something that caught my interest - and it never came."

The first half is especially bad, as it has some of the most boring, meaningless dialogues I've seen for some time, and zero comma-zero plots that you can talk about.

It is the spirit of Sean, her soul mate, who guides her to love, but it is her friends Matt, Annabel and Annabel's morose friend Raven who try to draw her to the dark side.","Like a relative who gives you a bad gift, Soul Survivors has his heart in the right place, but stumbles with a bad execution. Stephen Carpenter's writing / directorial work borrowed free from other, better films like Jacob's Ladder and Abre Los Ojos (Open Your Eyes). For those who have not seen any of these films, I will not give away the premise; Suffice to say that it is not nearly as well handled here as in these two superior films. <br /> <br /> Melissa Sagemiller plays the lead role as Cassie, who is just going to college. Her current boyfriend Sean (Ben Affleck) and her ex-boyfriend Matt (Wes Bentley), both friends, and Annabel (spicy Eliza Dushku) are in a car accident after being persecuted by two murderers (?) In transparent masks. She survives the wreck, but while attending college, there are visions of the ordeal of the hospital and dead people reappear and disappear, leaving them in a state of utter confusion: who is dead? Who lives? What is real? <br /> <br /> Soul Survivors looks like a bad old, finished, blood spattered, blood spattered teenager. True, it has its share of Killer Stalking The Victim scenes (copious, repetitive, and mind-boggling), but at least it's trying to cliché through ideas, but unfortunately it's rather unsuccessful. It brings confusion much more often than cohesion, as the story becomes messy, chaotic and incoherent near key points of the mystery (predictable as it is). <br /> <br /> Horror fans picking up a copy will have no idea they're involved in a movie that's more concerned with building a troubled facade of reality than providing a body count. Credit goes to Carpenter for trying to create something beyond a derivative teen horror movie; Too bad he created a derivative psycho thriller. Sagemiller also deserves credit for showing strength in the central performance, developing her character, and evoking a certain sense of emotion as the unraveling Cassie. It's great that the filmmakers try something different, but the movie ends with a mixed bag and a failed experiment. <br /> <br /> 4 out of 10"

Seriously, his name should be given the same reverence as Karloff, Lugosi and Price, and this film proves it. His character Herman was one of the 2 reasons I can give to see this movie. Dwight gave this slightly more than slightly disturbed outsider a loveable but scary appearance that made you hope for a bigger part of the entire movie. <br /> <br /> The other reason is the comic relief of M. Eburne. Being myself in medicine, I have to pay tribute to the expert performance of a self-pitying hypochondriac. Although other ""medical errors"" caused a brief giggle, especially when the good doctor scans his doctors colleagues ... ""Well, pass it on to her."" Unfortunately, these two outstanding achievements could not keep me awake with 3 attempts to get through unbearably Movie. The plot is predictable with only a few small twists. Shooting in a legitimate spooky atmosphere was more productive to make me yawn - yes, you can use too much shadow. <br /> <br /> My recommendation - take a look at it to see Frye and Eburne - but only when you're wide awake and with lots of caffeine."

Robert De Niro is one of the best Hollywood stars of all time, but even he could not save this movie. In fact, his character is very similar to the one he played in Cape Fear, which was actually pretty good, but I can not stand it when actors do the same thing about more than one movie. I think it's getting old, and that's the case here. <br /> <br /> There is nothing surprising in this film, but then the story has been told millions of times. Wesley Snipes is your typical baseball player and his imagination shows in his characterization. De Niro plays the obsessed fan, but his role in this movie is less than entertaining. <br /> <br /> However, since De Niro is in this movie, it makes a draw if you're a fan (no pun intended) who sees everything he does, no matter how bad. But to see De Niro in his best shape, watch ""Midnight Run"", ""Goodfellas"" or ""Cop Land"", or even go back and check out ""Taxi Driver"" or ""Godfather II"".

Without food, water, ammunition and medical supplies, only two hundred men survive after five days of siege.","When this film was first shown on television, I had high hopes that we would finally have a decent movie about World War I, as experienced by American soldiers. That's not it. <br /> <br /> It should be a good movie about the First World War. Although it was made for television, it is obvious that a real effort has been made to use appropriate equipment and props. But the writing and the direction are missing very much, even if the makers of this film obviously borrowed from some well-made war films. War movie stereotypes abound, like the arrogant general who apparently does not care about the lives of his men. When will Hollywood realize that although there were many bad generals, most of the combat unit's generals themselves have seen much fighting and are not naive about what the average grunt experiences? The first part of this movie seemed to be ""Paths of Glory"" with American uniforms. Except that ""Paths of Glory"" was emotionally enthralling. Later there was Chamberlain's accusation (except uphill) of ""Gettysburg"" and even the capture of the American soldier by a ring of enemy soldiers from ""The Thin Red Line"". But in ""The Thin Red Line"" the soldier was alone trapped. In this film, in the middle of a battle, a ring is formed around the new prisoner. <br /> <br /> If this movie uses a military advisor, ignore it. Although the actors (and I never forgot they were actors while watching) formed military tactics, I did not see much of it. The American soldiers got up to be shot while the Germans attacked. And the notorious stormtroopers, who seemed to be blind, did not seem to use tactics in their attack. In real war tactics was what made the stormtroopers so effective. But the dumbest scene was the attack of German flamethrowers. In this scene, the German flamethrower in a broad line towards the defending Americans. If that had been real, they would never have come close enough to use their flamethrowers before they were all thrown off the defenders' bullets. <br /> <br /> Okay, most war movies are unrealistic when it comes to tactics. But it is still disappointing. But what really distracted me from this streak was the typical anti-military point of view that filmmakers consider important. True, war is hell. But most American soldiers, though they grumble and complain, tend to believe in what they do and can be pretty coddled about it. My grandfather served in the First World War. And although he died four years before my birth, I was told how proud he was of his service."

The fat dragon is thicker in this outing than in ""condors,"" but he is no less sure of being a director or an actor. He is indeed at the forefront of his form and delivers a devastating, brutal action player who has half a dozen amazing sequences and manages to tell a compassionate, sweet love story. Love and romance are not the director's priorities here, but they serve as curious companions of the plot and ensure that viewers do not press the push button between physical clashes. <br /> <br /> The opening scene, with a funny lightsaber duel that emits a solid but deceptive tone. A sequence in which Sammo's Pedicab is tracked by a car is beautifully staged and sweetened with a sharp, weird tone. The fast and furious fight between Sammo and Lau Kar Leung is a model of dazzling choreography and sharp, brilliant directing and easily one of the best of its kind. The violence of the film slowly escalates until finally, when the climax of the showdown comes, we become one of the most brutal Confrontations that have ever occurred in a Sammo production. The director / actor's attack on Billy Chow and a house filled with angry, threatening opponents is a bone-breaking, physically punishing treat. <br /> <br /> Great on every level and one of the best martial arts films ever. <br /> <br /> Great score too."

The premise was not bad - scammers cheating on their way through college meet their match when they are discovered by someone with a suggestion for them. The problem is that the characters were all so dissimilar that I did not care about them. The blackmailer (played by the talented Jason Schwartzman) was a psychopath so it was not so funny to see him - he was not particularly funny or charming disturbed, he was just a crazy loser who was actually quite dangerous and not funny too see. The editing of the film was difficult to follow - he cut repeatedly between fantasy and reality and it was often unclear which was what. Only two or three of the gang's scams were really shown, you just had to believe that they were actually cheaters - showing their plans would have made a better movie. The so-called love story was absurd and unbelievable, in fact it was silly and poorly written and consistently directed. I could talk about the film's shortcomings, but you get the idea.

Their paths cross again and Rose helps the Doctor in fighting a race of plastics-based creatures whose home world may have been destroyed in a battle involving the Doctor. Rose seems like the perfect companion for his future travels.,"As an integral part of British pop culture such as Monty Python and James Bond, Doctor Who was a big hit for 26 years (1963-1989), making it one of the world's longest-running TV shows (most series are lucky) ten seasons). Plans to restart the series have always been on the BBC's agenda, and after a miscalculated (not to be Americanized) TV movie produced by Fox, he did not manage to complete the magic of the original version for nine years Captured (Comic Relief Parody and Animated Miniseries) were needed before the Ultimate Time Lord could properly return, courtesy of acclaimed writer Russell T. Davies. <br /> <br /> Davies Brilliance in reintroducing the character lies in his decision to do so through the eyes of an outsider: Rose Tyler (Billie Piper), a London-based young woman who leads a normal life, until one night it is attacked by living plastic creatures. She is rescued by an elusive stranger, who simply introduces herself as a doctor (Christopher Eccleston) and then disappears after annoying: ""Nice to meet you, Rose, run for your life!"". As she becomes more and more curious about this ""man,"" she soon finds herself in a whole new world: extraterrestrials, invasions, journeys through time and space, and of course the ubiquitous police box-shaped TARDIS. <br /> <The first 45 minutes of the new Doctor Who are almost perfect (the special effects could have been polished a bit more), because Davies noticed two things: the unique humor of the show and the two protagonists. The most original feature of the original series was their mix of spectacular science fiction and pure British comedy, a mixture that is difficult, if not impossible, to export. Here, the laughs are all connected to the conversations between Rose and the Doctor, which after a single episode appear as completely rounded characters. Ok, Eccleston's Doctor is the ninth to use that name, but he distances himself from the previous eight incarnations by speaking with a Nordic accent (which he uses daily) and stating it with a grandiose line: ""Many planets have a north ! "". <br /> <br /> The true triumph of this episode, however, is Piper's achievement: in theory, Rose is in her late teens, almost the same age as thousands of young audiences who have never heard of the doctor before. Her portrayal of an ordinary girl, lost in a new, exciting universe, represents the new generation's response to the return of a TV icon, and the chemistry that is currently forming between her and Eccleston is a sign of the new Doctor Who, the old one is just as good. <br /> <br /> First, fifth, ninth, it makes no difference: There might have been others before Eccleston (and Piper, for that matter), but together he is, William Hartnell, Peter Davison, and the rest of the bunch a single character, one so cool, he does not even need a name: he is THE Doctor."

Since all his novels have brought me a lot of entertainment and previous script adaptations were great, but boy, I was wrong. <br /> <br /> First, the people who did the casting had to fall asleep. I imagine the castings went something like that. ""Tell me, do you like fish?"" ""Yes, I like fish very much."" ""Wonderful, you're employed. Have some money."" <br /> <br /> Then there is the script. I read Chabon, which I hopefully went blind before he saw this piece of Dong, and it has absolutely nothing to do with his novel.

Makes it? Really? Of course not you plank. Please give me the Imodium. I will have a whole strip. <br /> <br /> The director is ... good. I do not have anything. Maybe Rawson Marshall Thurber has just learned that his grandmother exploded or something. Stay with the director of comedies.

She insists that a dingo has taken her baby, but the story is highly suspicious. The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case, the way Australians interpreted what was presented in the media, and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately resulted, based on barely any hard evidence of the woman's condemnation , I like films that challenge the media, and films that look closely at how people are hounded by the judiciary. I've always thought Jury's 12 Angry Men should be shown before they perform their duties. It is not, as has often been said, a liberal film, but a clinical look at how we as human beings interpret events that are based so much on our prejudices and desire for revenge. A cry in the dark is also clinical. Schepisi takes care not to make the film melodramatic. Some may find the movie boring or dry, but I found it interesting."

Aside from the predictability of the plot, some scenes in the movie really felt out of place with the plot (eg, a particular event at the wedding). At times, the film was a bit preachy in his ideas and in relation to the Franco era, the film was put in and the church.

The last way he goes down is particularly insistent in this context, as he narrows and increases his anxiety and nervousness. The last mechanical failure could be considered a death, and the miraculous rebirth of his motor in terms of a life after death, in which he achieved the desired reunion. <br /> <br /> I just hope some of the people who have branded this as A slow, melancholy melodrama takes the time to watch with a more holistic approach."

I have no problem with profuse swearing, as in ""Good Will Hunting,"" provided it helps to dive more into the characters. In this case, it was just hollow bantering in an attempt to get an occasional gasp or laughter from the audience.

With this rich material to draw on (and Patty playing in the final act), one might think that a Crack TV director like Gilbert Cates could film everything together, but ""Call Me Anna"" is a pale shadow from Duke's autobiography. For those who have not read the book, the sketchy narrative (moving forward in time) is not receptive, we must never identify with what is happening right now, and production seems to be constrained by a low budget. The cast is misfired, and the value of making Duke appear at last does not pay off - the film's fake reality is so big at the time that Patty can not bring stability to the scenario.

So it was calculated on the box, and I thought, What a great idea! There is also a ""Welcome to Oakland"" sign on the cover. How could I resist? Unfortunately, the hip-hop part lasted only as long as the opening theme. Neither hip-hop music nor hip-hop culture played a major role in the film. Having lived in Oakland myself, I know there are many aspiring hip-hop artists there, so the low budget of this strip was no excuse for not having the right soundtrack. A number of artists who struggled had taken the opportunity to contribute to this film. Why the Quiroz Brothers did not take advantage of that is a mystery to me. <br /> <br /> Once the movie started rolling, it was a typical zombie movie with a cast that happened to be all black and latino. You'd think that would take the movie in an unusual direction ... but it did not. Somehow, the vision of the Quiroz Brothers of Urban Culture comes down to drive-by shootings and dropping an F-bomb on every line of the movie. The quick use of the word ""Fuck"" is probably the most characteristic feature of this film; there were single lines that contained the word three or four times, and no line contained it at least once. I'm not squeamish in a movie at all, but the feeling here was that it was the result of a lack of ideas from the writers (including the Quiroz brothers), and the script was generally very poor. Br /> <br / > The movie was generally a disappointment. It would have been interesting to see a real ""Urban Culture"" zombie strip, but ""Hood of the Living Dead"" does not stick to it.

It's a fitting movie for this timeline, as it's really hard to follow and pretty weird (see the other reviews for specific story info). Anyway, after intercepting it several times just before cable TV at the time (and even after it had landed, but before they had been programming all night), I kept catching up with that little curiosity. After not seeing it for many years, I decided to see if I could find it on DVD. Well, it's only available (from any search I've done anyway) in a pretty lousy grainy print on the budget label called ""Brentwood Video"" as part of a 4-pack of movies (4 movies on 2 double-sided discs) "" Alien Worlds ""if anyone is interested. It's usually available for about $ 10 - but much less when you shop. The other 3 movies on this set are available in numerous other collections of public domain movies, so they do not need to be commented here. But I have not seen ""Eyes"" anywhere else. Although hardly a ""recovered"" version in any way, this print runs exactly 92 minutes, so for once IMDb specified runtime of 90 minutes is not correct. Even with a running time of 92 minutes, it's not uncommon for a movie that has been dubbed from another language to be in English to trim some of its duration. It seems to be a common practice to save money by not copying some scenes if they are not considered important to the story. Would a longer version be less confusing? Who really knows - unless you've seen it in his mother tongue ... Incidentally, my attempts to see it during the day do not work and I just turn it off.

But the changes in the neighborhood and the student body have frustrated him and he decides he'll hang it up. It gets dicey when a few robbers take over the school as a base for a tank raid while they are detained over a group of students. His dolph against the bad guys in a fight to the death. Jaw Drop throw back to the exploitation films of the late Grindhouse era, where bad guys dressed up as punks and some of the bad women had day glow hair. What a stupid movie. I can not believe that people did that. This is an action movie that was probably doomed to failure from the beginning, before the low budget, the bad breakaway sets and the bad action direction were even a wink. See how late in the movie the cars drive through the school (do not ask), they crash into the security turrets (do not ask because it looks more like a jail than a high school) and smash their barely constructed form looks in earlier ones Recordings are not so. What did the gods do to bad movies? Actually, I'm perplexed, since it was directed by Sydney J Furie, a really good director who filmed films like The Boys in Company C. Has his ability failed him or was he hopeless from the start and did not bother him at all? It is a turkey. A worth seeing but a turkey nonetheless."
10,tt0141842,1,"An innovative look at the life of fictional Mafia Capo Tony Soprano, this serial is presented largely first person, but additional perspective is conveyed by the intimate conversations Tony has with his psychotherapist. We see Tony at work, at home, and in therapy. Moments of black comedy intersperse this aggressive, adult drama, with adult language, and extreme violence.","The Sopranos is probably the biggest show in the history of dramatic television. <br /> <br /> It's hard to think of another series that offers so much intelligence, sublime writing or first-rate performances. <br /> <br /> Everywhere epic it produces fresh and iconic characters and a consistent quality. The focus is on the life of a Tony Soprano, a man who lives in two families. One is the conventional wife and two children, the other a huge New Jersey mafia group, of which he is the boss of both. James Gandolfini plays True Romance and The Mexican, and Tony is a fascinating, scary but also likable guy. Gandolfini must be fully praised for turning a proliferating and cruelly aggressive blank into a truly identifiable and perfect leader. Contemporary American drama has never had such a captivating and iconic character as Tony. <br /> <br /> The occupation of hundreds never offers a flat performance and such outstanding characters as Paulie Walnuts and Ralph Cifaretto will be remembered forever. <br /> <br /> The true genius of this story, however, is that the Creator and the writers bravery and revolution take over a conventional drama series. Twenty-minute dream sequences, powerful and original use of symbolism and metaphorical images and truly shocking scenes of violence. But all of this applies to truly moving themes such as love, honor, and family respect. The series never gets cold-hearted or groundless. <br /> <br /> Now competitive with TV and often poor The Sopranos stands high above the rest as America's most original and compelling drama. Forget the family redefined. This is Television Redifined."
3,tt0091969,0,A group of popular students play a cruel prank on a shy nerd resulting in a terrible accident. Years later a reunion is held where each of the students face a stalker killer who may be the same nerd out for revenge.,"The film begins with a review of Doddsville County High School on April Fool's Day. A group of students play a joke on class nerd Marty. If they are punished for playing this prank, they will follow a bigger prank that goes ridiculously (as with Slasher movies with pranks on class nerds) and Marty is simultaneously burned by the fire and acidified by acid to thoroughly his . Nearly five years later, when we meet members of the student body who meet in the now deserted high school for their five-year class reunion. We note that it is no coincidence that everyone at the reunion has listened to the clique of jokes from the flashback as all participants are being persecuted and killed by a mysterious masked murderer in ever more complicated and absent-minded cases. It does not take Sherlock Holmes to solve the mystery of the murderer's identity, since it's a scarred Marty, who seems to have used his nerdousness and high intellect to bend the laws of physics and engineering to rig the school for himself revenge scenario. The movie takes a turn for the bizarre as Marty ends his revenge on his former tormentors just to be haunted by their ghosts. Marty is finally pushed over the edge and takes his own life. Eventually, the film explodes in a crescendo of incoherent weirdness as the whole revenge scenario turns out to be a dream as Marty wakes up in a hospital bed, freeing himself from his shackles, stabbing a nurse and finally disfiguring his own face. <br /> <br /> The script is tired and suffers from horror movie logic. The only originality comes from the amazingly intricate ways in which the victims are sent. The absurd ""all-for-a-dream ending"" feels pinned. It's almost as if someone pointed out the disconnected nature of the film, and the author decided then and there that it was a dream. <br /> <br /> Technically, the movie is horrible. Some scenes were filmed so dark that I had to stop the movie and play with the color on my TV. The drama is below average, even for Slasher movies. I can not help but think that casting was part of the problem, as all actors are at least five years older than the characters they portray, making the flashback scene even more unintentionally ridiculous. Their lack of commitment to the film becomes apparent as half of them do not bother to keep their accents straight through the movie. <br /> <br /> All this said, if you like bad horror movies, you might like this one too. It's not the worst movie in the genre, but it's far from the best."
7,tt0083806,1,"To make Sidney's slump all the more painful, Clifford Anderson, a student of one of Sidney's writing seminars, has recently sent his mentor a copy of his first attempt at playwrighting for Sidney's review and advice. The play, ""Deathtrap,"" is a five character, two act thriller so perfect in its construction that, as Sidney says, ""A gifted director couldn't even hurt it."" Using his penchant for plot, and out of his desperate desire to once again be the toast of Broadway, Sidney, along with Myra, cook up an almost unthinkable scheme: They'll lure the would-be playwright to the Bruhl home, kill him, and market the sure-fire script as Sidney's own. But shortly after Clifford arrives, it's clear that things are not what they seem! Indeed, even Helga Ten Dorp, a nosey psychic from next door, and Porter Milgram, Sidney's observant attorney, can only speculate where the line between truth and deception lies.","Unlike Tinseltown's version of HELLO, DOLLY !, Jay Presson Allen's screen adaptation of Ira Levin's Broadway thriller hit could not wait for the stage to be embodied before he put it on the screen, and the producers opted for the best make it out white way! The opening and closing scenes of the film will be shot at the New York Music Box Theater, where DEATHTRAP played for almost five years. Even the final fade out of the film on the theater tent is a version of the famous logo of the stage play. (Although the marketing people have decided to use a funnier Rubik's Cube icon for the movie.) Now, on a budget DVD release, DEATHTRAP is just as fresh and inventive as ever. The cast is just right (better than their stage counterparts) and location scouts should be applauded to find a fittingly spooky house for our ""one-bedroom, two-act thriller"". Opened in a surprisingly simple and innovative way, director Sidney Lumet marks every ""new"" material wisely at the beginning and at the end of the film, leaving Levin's malevolent center alone. <br /> <br /> The final scene of the movie is a big Hollywood run off the boards and undermines some of Levin's plot shows from earlier in the movie [Helga (via a dagger): ""Being used by another woman, BECAUSE it's game. ""]. Like Robert Altman's THE PLAYER, our new finale will help us refold the film and blur the boundaries between stage, screen, and (could it?) True life!"

Not long after that, unexplainable things happen to the family and, one by one, they begin to die.","Ever heard of a Taiwanese horror movie? Or any Taiwanese movie? Probably for a reason. This one was really boring even though it has black magic, including weathered baby corpses and people exploding inside with thousands of eels. <br /> <br /> After reading other people's thoughts, I was looking forward to some violence and blood, but there is not much. Puking some blood and other lame things, if you're waiting for graphics gore or any gruesome effects, you'll be disappointed. They exploded the eel and did not use other things to their maximum potential. <br /> <br /> Pretty much nothing good about this movie; a single character who was not completely boring and some good black spells like the eel. The plot was confusing and boring. The characters were thin and annoying, including the main character. The horror aspect did not work at all, the most frightening thing was an albino girl (not really scary). This is the worst Asian horror movie I have ever seen."

The case is assigned to detectives Cassie 'the hyena' Mayweather, who carries a sequoia-size chip on the shoulder from her previous life, and her brilliant new partner, Sam Kennedy, who just transferred from the vice squad; they can work together very well, and even fit romantically, but fall out over different professional attitudes towards the investigation, which Captain Rod Cody and her understandably vindictive abused ex, Assistant D.A.

Cool kid Richard Haywood (Half Nelsons Ryan Gosling) and Justin Pendleton (Bully's Michael Pitt) work together to murder a random girl to challenge herself and see if they can get away with it without the police finding her. The murder case is the murder detective Cassie ""The Hyena"" Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) with new partner Sam Kennedy (Ben Chaplin), who is evidenced by the evidence found in the scene, e.g. unrelated hair. The plan does not seem to be going very well, because Cassie and Sam are quick to spot Richard or Justin as suspects, it's just a matter of throwing them away. Also with Agnes Bruckner as Lisa Mills, Chris Penn as Ray Feathers, R.D. Call as Captain Rod Cody and Tom Verica as Asst. THERE. Al Swanson. I now see the same concept as Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Rope in murdering a challenge, but this film does it in a very silly way and not even a reasonably good Bullock can keep it from being boring and predictable.

He's sent to a juvenile detention facility where he doesn't do much better. He does manage to escape however.","This movie aka ""The Four Hundred Beats"" is a mistranslation. Faire Les 400 Coups ""means"" to live a wild life. As a Frenchman, I am stunned when I see the popularity of this good but by no means outstanding film. 1. It is not the first film of the ""nouvelle vague"" movie, see Agnes Varda's ""la pointe courte"", (1956) Alain Resnai's ""Hiroshima mon amour"" (1958), Claude Chabrol's ""le beau serge"" (1958) anterior Historically, ""Les 400 Coups"" comes afterwards. 2. The ""nouvelle vague"" was sometimes cumbersome and hard on its predecessors: overnight, Julien Duvivier, Henri-George Clouzot, Claude Autant-Lara, Yves allégret and many others were condemned to oblivion. This selfishness and contempt is typically ""nouvelle vague"". You have never heard (or read) the great generation of thirties (Renoir, Carné, Grémillon, Duvivier, Feyder), say, Maurice Tourneur or Max Linder. So, thanks to Truffaut and Co Some people will never discover the jewels of the French fifties or forties (Duvuvier's ""Sous le Ciel de Paris"", Autant-Lara's ""Douce"", Yves Allégret's ""une si jolie petite plage"" and ""manèges"") so much to say that William Wyler, Georges Stevens and Fred Zinemann were worthless! 3. ""Les 400 Coups"" is technically rather disappointing: it's very academic, the story is as linear as it can be, the teachers are caricatures, and the mother Claire Maurier delivers such memorable lines as (you have to be a Frenchman) 1960, to understand how ridiculous it is): Well, your father has only his Brevet and, like me, I only have my high school diploma, you have to know that in 1960 barely 10% of students had HSD in France! Antoine Doinel should finally have been proud of his mother! She wants him to have diplomas, who can blame her? 4. In contrast to the innovations of ""Hiroshima mon amour"", which have a completely new form and a new ""fragmented"" content, ""les 400 coups"" become meaningful. The Truffaut will master a new form only with the supremely superior ""Jules"" and Jim, ""supported by the incomparable Jeanne Moreau. 5. The interpretation is rather stiff, Jean-Pierre Léaud, who is probably heard when dubbing in English will still be decent, but he will soon degenerate to the most affected of his generation 6. The theme = stolen childhood had better days before (Julien Duvivier's ""Poil de Carotte"", Luis Bunuel's ""los olvidados"") and afterwards (Maurice Pialats ""l'enfance nue"", Kenneth Loach's ""Kes"") I did not want to humiliate Truffaut, his film is not bad, but, frankly, French film fans, ""Jules and Jim"" prefer ""enfant sauvage"" ( a movie honest, true and commercially uncompromising to a debt) ""l'argent de poche"" (as academic as ""400 coups"" but much funnier) or his nice hitchcock pastiche ""vivement dimanche"". <br /> <br />"

There are some outstanding performances, most notably by Josh Hamilton (of With Honors), Jerry O'Connell (Sliders), who played brothers divided by the war. Bill Smitrovich, a character actor who has long been ignored by many, gives a heartfelt performance when his stern father, compelled to question his own beliefs and values ​​as one of his sons, proudly goes to Vietnam but returns empty-handed inside, while the other is just the opposite. All in all, this is a powerful and heartwarming movie that I hope everyone has a chance to experience."

Family values ​​are praised and the main characters of the film will evolve to end up against the grasshoppers. And there are some great voice-overs by Dave Foley, Julia-Louise Dreyfus, Kevin Spacey (of course), ... But actually, the most amazing thing about this movie is the animation. It's just wonderful. Every detail, great color, every ant looks different, beautiful backgrounds ... And the guys and girls from Pixar have made everything look so realistic. All in all a very nice piece of work. This is the best animation of Disney since Aladdin."

As Geist's mysterious Underground Agenda escalates, will he become the ""last big thing"", or be co-opted by the very forces he is railing against?","""The Last Big Thing"" is a wonderful satirical film that sardonically brings pop culture to the point of humorous self-destruction. The characters are so interesting and it's fun to laugh / sympathize with them. That brings me to an introduction to the characters I liked the most. <br /> <br /> Simon Geist is a man of his late 30s / early 40s who creates a pop culture-driven editorial magazine called ""The Next Big Thing."" The point is, this magazine does not exist really, and it's just an excuse for Simon to get close to the actors by interviewing them just to make them silly by offending their way of shopping into pop culture, and his live-in girlfriend Darla also writes one Magazine (which is real), which mainly has to do with her and Simon, as well as with her and her dad, Darla is a genuinely amiable (or repulsible) character, depending on how you see her muted neurotic behavior.

Their futuristic hardware is largely developed by a genius scientist known as Brains, who lives at the International Rescue base on Tracy Island, somewhere in the Pacific.","I still have not seen everything; It's just on the cable, and I always seem to intervene. My main reason is that I'm a fan of Bill Paxton; He is a pretty good actor, and has been doing consistently well throughout his career. <br /> <br /> The other thing that's turned on is that, while never really a fan of the old series, I kinda want Thunder for the ships and effects work. Derek Meddings was probably the best in the industry in the sixties and seventies, and his designs for the International Lifeboat are wonderful. The current team has done a good job transferring their work to the big screen. <br /> <br /> BUT ... <br /> <br /> This is a lame story. The kids are asked to drive it, and while doing an okay job, it's hard to dispel the disbelief, especially if you have Brains' eight-year-old son flies T2, a massive multi-ton transport with all the aerodynamics a Buick. Everywhere you look you will see a Ford logo. Product placement is overkill here, and it's annoying. Ben Kingsley does a good job as The Hood, but he can only do so much with a one-dimensional role. If you can accept the movie on its very low merits, Thunderbirds is a fun, entertaining ride. Do not look too closely at the machines that propel them. <br /> <br /> ADDENDUM: I've finally seen it all and it's worse than I thought. The drama is pretty equally bad, and while the effects are pretty good, the story has become cheesier on several considerations. The exaggerated product placement for Ford is annoying, and the kids as main characters irritate my nerves. As with The Avengers, it's bearable if you ignore the source material. But not very. Take a look at the original show and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> And a word of advice to Jon Frakes. Do a refresher course in the Director's Guild. You can do better than that, old friend. <br /> <br /> One more footnote ... <br /> <br /> I saw that again. Last night. On Telemundo. Synchronized in Spanish with kitschy comedy sound effects. And yes, I came in about halfway with Ben, Ron and Sophia in their fight scene on Tracy Island. <br /> <br /> I did not think it was possible that an already lame movie would get worse, but it was. It was awfully bad. <br /> <br /> If this had just been done, no child-to-rescue, no ironic jokes, it might have worked. As it is, it's just another beloved childhood joy that has been ruined."

As the seasons change, Ruby's relationships with others and herself go through metamorphoses as she makes choices and discoveries establishing her own identity. A character study.","Very slow, but complicated structured and ultimately very touching. A beautiful, very lifelike view of a small beach town in Florida in the middle of winter - I was there, and that's absolutely correct. <br /> <br /> It's also the debut feature of actress Ashley Judd, and she makes a big impression here. It's hard to believe this movie is 12 years old - I remember seeing him in cinemas and I recently rented ""Ruby"" again. Apart from the 80s, it has done very well. Ashely is so radiant and touching here that it's hard to think about her later career without flinching. Boy, talk about not fulfilling your early promise! Anyone who sees Ashley here in ""Ruby In Paradise"" would think that this elegant, natural beauty leads to all sorts of interesting art films and serious acting - instead, she has become the ""go to"" girl for stupid action movies and slasher movies! Very disappointing, but at least we have received this beautiful achievement to present their early promises. <br /> <br /> As some other commentators say, this is not for everyone as it is very slow. This is not an action movie, nor is it really a romance. The director (Victor Nuñez, ""Ulees Gold"", another excellent character study) treats the life of this ordinary young woman with great respect and lets her story build slowly and with much detail. In that way, I think this is one of the most moving and respectful stories about young women I can remember - it's not about Ruby's sexual awakening or ""how she lost her virginity"", but about her life choices and her growing maturity. <br /> <br /> A nice movie, if you take the time to see it ... I think it would be a really excellent movie to show teenagers and young girls (or boys). and give them a chance to think and discuss it. <br /> <br /> Special thanks to director Nunez, who also wrote the screenplay, which is so realistic and beautifully detailed that I have accepted the entire film that it was based on a novel or memoir written by women but in fact it is the original work of Mr. Nunez.

In my opinion, all the movies in her novels are a bit boring, but I like Austen's characters because they all have a certain personality and typical sayings that they like to repeat, as in Emma. What makes Emma good is Gwyneth Paltrow, she is very good in her lead role. Also, the fact that each of the characters in the film is unable to think otherwise than to find a good partner and soon to be married makes the movie hilarious."

If you think anyone in the South is stupid, morally bankrupt, stupid, violent, a religious mother or a child molester, then maybe this movie is for you. Everyone is poor and seemingly ignorant. In one scene, two older men talk in a grocery store and one mentions that he had abused a number of sisters before they could tie their shoes. The man seemed to be proud of his actions, and the other man obviously took it as a normal part of life. Very nice. A young girl is walking in the street after her sister and no one offers her help - despite obvious limping and lack of food or water (no backpack, etc.). Strathairn's character is not only disgusting and slimy through and through, but he also appears as a religious believer who (typical of Hollywood) reflects the wicked nature of the Christians. One scene in the film is reminiscent of the end of Cape Fear (the one with DeNiro) - Bible verses are broadcast by the villain. I'm from the big Northwest, but I found this movie offensive because of the wonderful people I know from NC, WV, AL, MS, KY, TN etc."

He gets a job as a salesman, has surgery on his foot, receives an inheritance, and returns to school where he learns Mildred is dying.","Today, actresses gain weight slightly, dye their hair, dress like slobs and lose their luster for a role, and Bette Davis was probably the actress who started the trend. Even as a pretty young woman who occasionally wore designer clothes and Constance Bennett makeup in movies, Davis was ready to devastate herself to create a character both outside and inside. <br /> <br /> Her determination shows in her breakout film ""Of Human Bondage"", starring Leslie Howard as Philip Carey. Davis plays Mildred, a lusty, manipulative, greedy low-life for Howard's masochistic, club-footed Philip. He first meets her when she is a waitress, and she allows him to take her to the food and theater while she plays with a wealthy older man (Alan Hale Sr.). In fact, Mildred is repulsed by Philip's clubfoot. On his part, Philip seems to enjoy the abuse of her open flirtation and her coolness towards him. He allows Mildred to bleed him financially, among the friends who drop her when they get tired while blowing some really lovely women (Kay Johnson and Frances Dee). When he gets the courage to throw her out, Mildred shatters his apartment and robs him, forcing him to retire from the medical school and lose his shelter. <br /> <br /> ""Human bondage"" looks quite stilted today. Although Leslie Howard was a wonderful actor and attractive, his acting style is from a more formal old school, and so he tends to file whatever he is. He shines in material such as his role opposite Davis in ""It's Love I'm After"" or ""The Petrified Forest"" that demand its kind of technique. His dated acting is even more obvious here, because Davis was breaking new ground with a gritty, edgy performance that would really make her name. If she seems exaggerated at times, she came off the stage, and the intricacies of filmmaking would later come to her mind. Contrast this achievement with the restraint, warmth, and gentleness of her Henriette in All All, and Heaven Too, or the pathos that brought her to Dark Victory. She was a true actress and a true artist. Davis really does allow himself to look like a holy hell; Mildred's deterioration is absolutely pathetic, as Philip seems to gain strength as her mind fades. <br /> <br /> An excellent movie in which to see the puckering of one of the movie's biggest stars."

Meanwhile the deceased Joe discloses the identity of the tarot card serial killer of London. He cheats the Reaper and appears to the American student of journalism Sondra Pransky, who is on the stage in the middle of a magic show of the magician Sidney Waterman in London, and tells her that the murderer is the aristocrat Peter Lyman. Sondra drags Sid in her investigation, seeking for evidences that Peter is the killer. However, she falls in love with him and questions if Joe Strombel is right in his scoop.","Something happens to Sondra Pransky as she enters the magic box on the stage of a London theater. Little does Sondra know that the ghost of newly-deceased journalist Joe Strombel materializes to ask her to ask the man to investigate someone, on his journey in another dimension, is the infamous tarot killer who is on a binge of crime been in London. The only problem is the man is charged, for all appearances, a respectable upper class man. <br /> <br /> When Sondra recounts her experience in the Great Splendini, aka Sid Waterman, the wizard is stunned, but decides to go along. The two would P.I. Invite an invitation to a club where Peter Lyman goes swimming. Sondra, who drowns her fake, catches the attention of this hunk, who wants to see more of her. Needless to say, the two of them get into all sorts of fun situations until the mystery gets revealed at the end of the movie. The real Tarot killer does not think he can fool a resolute Sondra who proves she's more resourceful than he has trusted her. <br /> <br /> The result is a perfect summer movie with a lot of laughter what you need to get from the heat to the perfect time in a cool theater. Woody Allen has done better, and yet this sunny comedy will justify him for past failures. In ""Scoop"", Mr. Allen has said goodbye to the romantic top of his gorgeous lead actress. Gesturing his brand is something this funny man will never get rid of as it seems to be his brand. The film has some funny liners that go overboard for those who are not careful. <br /> <br /> Scarlett Johansson, the beautiful star of ""Scoop"", seems to be the perfect foil for Woody Allen. She plays the straight part while Mr. Allen does his shit, a perfect combination. Both are excellent in their banter during the movie. Ms. Johansson is a knockout beauty in her red bathing suit, though she has dressed her so old-fashioned in most of the costumes she wears on the screen. Hugh Jackman is considered Peter Lyman, a cultured man in the city with the right pedigree. He makes a good showing in the movie as the man who chases Ms. Johansson. Ian McShane plays the dead Fleet Street journalist on his way to eternity. <br /> <br /> ""Scoop"" is thanks to Woody Allen a light film for the hot and humid summer."

Mark Gatiss, Reece Shearsmith and Steve Pemberton are terrific actors and performers who are at home with drama and comedy. With the support of their writing partner Jeremy Dyson, they have populated the series with the most memorable characters of recent years. Little Britain fades as a faint imitation of her ideas of insignificance. Consistently original and groundbreaking, I am sure that so many people hate these series as they love, but I'm just as certain that no one could have an opinion on LOG. I have not seen the movie yet, but I have heard good and bad things, so I'll reserve the verdict. The original radio series from which LOG came was as innovative as the TV series.

However, they decided to have a complete recast and not really one hundred, not even one hundred and two, but only three puppies and a parrot who thought he was a dog (smart). Gerard Depardieu's role was meaningless. In the end, Cruella suffers too much, too humiliating and too over the top to be true. She is baked in a giant cake.

The Halperin, Howard Higgin and Rollo Lloyd script, all uncredited, has a good central idea, but is killed dead as it's boring and so exciting how to paint paint. Not much happens for a long time, and not much happens after that. How Halperin depicts his zombies is different than what most modern audiences would consider a zombie, these zombies are just brainwashing and the audience has to wait more than 30 years for George A. Romero to define what a zombie is now in the Night of the Living Dead (1968). At just about an hour in length, Revolt of the Zombies still feels too long. Technically, the film is OK, considering that it was made 70 years ago, black and white cinematography is appropriate, though some of the scenes look like they were shot against a photograph of the background. The spectacle is wooden and largely unimpressive. Revolt of the zombies may have been hot in 1936, but it did not turn out well and in 2005 it's an absolute must to persevere. I think the movie is now a public domain because it appears on many ultra-cheap DVD compilations and budget labels, but it's still not worth watching, no matter how cheap it gets."

To tell the truth, the only reason I went for this movie was because he shared his name with the Radiohead song, and also because my friend had bought the tickets, so I really had no choice: -DI Pending it should be something like The Silence of the Lambs, but it turned out to be half-assed strips. Someone has already mentioned that none of the characters are sympathetic, and that's absolutely right. I really did not care if Potentes character tore her guts off the creep. I've been trying to get the homeless to bring Potentes character to life. Christopher Smith did a great job with the visual aspect of the film. However, the story is pretty weak, but then the whole point of the movie was to make the crap out of you, and that was pretty effective. The score of a Bristol band called The Insects was first-rate. That scared me more than anything else. <br /> <br /> The director was a really decent kid and was entertaining during the Q & A session. I really hope that he will make better films in the future. <br /> <br /> This is for genre fans only, but I would recommend non-fans to try it anyway. It was a fun ride."

Unfortunately, as I found out last night, that was not the case. Revolver is so outrageously bad. I'm just thinking of recommending friends to visit them just so I do not feel like I'm the only one stupid enough to get carried away to watch this. It's really amazing how much this movie completely falls on its face with the constant, and I mean CONSTANT Voice Overs the main characters, with totally naughty, swanky nonsense! I got really mad at the movies and heard Andre Benjamin's utterly merciless roar for something that seemed like half the movie, all the while thinking - what would Turkish have done with that complete joke of gangster / cheater, whatever it was supposed to be, when he made his ""offer""? I will tell you what. He would have told him to get away, blow his head off, and watch with utter contempt as his equally awkward partner waddled away as quickly as his small, plump legs would carry him. I mean, what are we supposed to believe going through Jake's head, offering him her ""solution"" to his problem? They are cheaters, so obviously they must also have the ability to cure incurable blood diseases! I mean ffs. Does he not confuse himself, why his symptoms do not get worse? Not on the third day of the penny, what happens instead of Richie submitting the audience to a painfully upcoming call from Avi to Jake to let him know he was cheated? Anyway, I can add a little positive note to the movie by giving way to dry humor if it offers a similar standard to its previous films. Bulls ** t! This movie does not try to be as smart as redeeming yourself with some well-timed amusing lines, oh no. It has somehow managed to be so disastrously gross that I have not really heard much more than a titer from a fully packed movie theater ?? and everyone who knows the UGC in Sheffield knows how full a main screen can be, not a person who smiled. Maybe he never wanted the movie to be funny and to be fair, you can still make good gangster movies without comedy, but what is he planning to hang up this movie may I ask? The unnecessarily confusing plot! I sincerely hope not! <br /> <br /> By far the most satisfying moment I experienced last night was to hear the very loud sighing from ALL directions of the audience as everyone desperately prayed for the movie to end. It was also quite amusing to see how quickly the cartridges fought and ran to the exits after they realized it was over, and they were free of their agony. <br /> <br /> I'll round it off ( I ') I have to finish, the writing makes me angry again), by going to the ""end"". I mean sh ** t! The end? No, I'm sorry, I can not, you'll just have to see it. It can not be put into words, it simply can not, and once you've seen it, you'll know why. Uuhhhhh ?? Shower?"

As it stands, ""Zentropa"" (or ""Europe,"" as it is called outside the US) is one of the most intriguing and artistic views of desolation and almost psychotic uncertainty that erupted after the Second World War, namely the decimated German landscape whose physical horrors were only accompanied by the damage to the psyche of their people. Von Trier paints his vision on the canvas. You'll feel like you're seeing a lost late 1940s spy-noir classic with its perfectly lit black-and-white scenes, while at the same time having the feeling of being a little off the cutting edge, especially in scenes like that Assassination aboard the train. When you see this movie, you literally experience the evolution of an art form. <br /> <br /> For this reason Von Trier got into his own dogma movement shortly thereafter. And while ""Breaking the Waves"" and ""Dancer in the Dark"" are classics themselves, ""Zentropa"" has taken the art of filmmaking to new and exciting heights. 10/10, age like a good wine, and asks for a DVD release."

But, once more, things will go from bad to worse, when Cinderella's father, too, dies, leaving her all alone in the Lady's clutches to serve as her maid-of-all-work. Under those circumstances, a shabby and neglected Cinderella doesn't stand much of a chance of attending the King's royal ball--let alone, captivate the handsome Prince--unless she turns to her loving Fairy Godmother who has quite a few tricks up her sleeve. Nevertheless, will the wronged damsel ever find peace--and with it--her own Prince Charming?","but ""Cinderella"" gets my vote not only for the worst Disney princess movie, but also for the worst movie the company made during Walt's lifetime. The music is really pretty and history deserves to be called ""classic"". What fails in this film are the characters, especially the title character, who in the broadest sense of the word can only be called ""heroine"". <br /> <br /> After a short prologue, the audience will be introduced to Cinderella. She wakes up in the morning and sings ""A dream is a wish your heart makes."" This justifies her as an idealist (and thus deserves our sympathy). Unfortunately, the script gives us no indication of what she's dreaming about. Freedom from her servant role? The respect of her stepfamily? Someone except mice and birds? In a song (excerpt from the film, but in the special features of the latest DVD) Cinderella tells of her wish that there could be many of her to make her work more efficient. You are going girlfriend! In short, Cinderella is a very mild character. She passively accepts the abuse of her stepfamily and escapes into her unspoken dreams. She asserts herself only once, reminding her stepmother that she is still a family member. But she gets permission to play the ball when she does her housework and finds something to wear, a symbolic gesture that is clearly absurd for everyone, except, of course, for Cinderella. Can anyone see that Belle or Jasmine is such a doormat? When Cinderella is bored, her male counterpart is lifeless. The prince in Cinderella gets no dialogue and almost no screen time. We are not given any indication as to whether he is a good man, whether he respects Cinderella or something. All we know is 1) he is a prince and 2) he dances well. Damn, even the Prince of ""Snow White"" has at least been able to sing a romantic song. This lack of development not only makes Romance less interesting, it also makes Cinderella look like a social mountaineer or an idiot and weakens her already weak appeal. <br /> <br /> Perhaps when you realize how boring the main characters were, animators decided to give the comic relief of the movie to Cinderella's friends, the mice, excessive screen time. Granted, these characters are amusing. Still, if the comic relief steals the show from the clients, well, let's just say your story has some problems. <br /> <br /> Dinsey loves to proclaim all of his animated features as ""masterpieces"". While many of them are, there are some who do not deserve this appellation in any way. Cinderella is a prime example of this."

For one, it was one of those ""loosely novel-based"" movies, which usually means that the author saw the script, hated it, and refused to be associated with the film. Worse, the trailer showed only the most banal slapstick, which is conceivable (eg: child is sprayed with a garden hose in the face ... and falls over). When my little brother put it in his head, this was the must - have movie of the season (of course he was thinking the same thing about ""cars"", ""about the hedge"", ""the ant swarm"", ""monster house"", etc, etc admittedly, I was less than enthusiastic. <br /> <br /> But once in the cinema, the movie convinced me for a variety of reasons. First and foremost, the authors capture the ""children's dialogue"" better than any other children's film I've ever seen. A good example of this comes right after the headmaster accidentally ate a worm in an egg omelet. The boys make a lame, over the exaggerated impression that the headmaster is teaching them what makes them realistic, since all the little kids (mistakenly) think they are making big mockery of their adult tormentors. Then one of the boys asks, ""Why did he say, 'Alley oop'?"" Another boy answers, ""Maybe he's crazy!"" and the whole group laughs loudly. Not a hilarious response, but the kind of thing a young child would devise on the spot, and the kind of remark that other kids of his age would find funny. As if to confirm, my little brother laughed right at the cue when they were spoken on the screen; I could practically hear his voice, which produced exactly the same lines when he got into a similar situation. <br /> <br /> Another reason why the movie works is that the authors seem to make problems like bullying, sibling relationships, creating new kid at school, and peer pressure / conformity without making any of them as if they were subplots for any after-school special. For example, the bully (Joe) is not stereotyped; he is definitely bad, but not pure evil, and just enough of his home life reveals that the audience feels sympathy for him and understands his bullying origins. Nor is there a ""Cue the dramatic music"" moment where Billy ('Worm Boy') realizes what a complete tool he is to his younger brother, Woody, and yet, at the end of the film, a sort of minor transformation has been made. There is some realism here in the way the characters solve situations and the way they relate to each other, and very little of it looks cheesy. <br /> <br /> The film's only drawback comes in the form of an absolutely ridiculous dance scene that even the creators of the infamous McDonald's dance party in ""Mac and Me"" would mock. Why, oh why was it put into the movie? Has Austin Rogers (Adam) pulled a Macaulay Culkin and refused to take the role unless he got a vehicle to show off his oh so impressive dancing skills? The entire sequence definitely did not have to be there and was a little less funny than any given show on ""The History Channel"". Overall, though, this film was excellent, and the length (about an hour and twenty minutes) was almost perfect. One of the best and most realistic live action children's movies you'll ever see, when you're ever around kids or just remembering what it's like to be a kid."

You have never seen so much in a movie. If this really had a budget of $ 20 million, most of it would have had to run on Mr. Piano's shoes because he had to endure many couples with all the running he does. This explains why there is no money for decent effects, a decent video camera or real actors. Honestly, it's like a bizarre fetish video for people who want to do something with long walks in period costumes. Even in the forerun, this is a loooonggg walk. <br /> <br /> As for the science-fiction stuff, I think it was a mistake to bring Martians into the movie: they only hinder walking, which is clearly more interesting to the director than the story. <br /> <br /> I wonder how much Mr. Piano requires dogs to go?"

That would have been much better if it had not set the sleaze factor very high, but that would not make it great anyway. I would like to point out another movie called THE ASSAULT (1996) by Jim Wynorski, which resembles the identity of ALIENATOR. It shows why first-person femme fatale action movies do not work well in America. Sorry, guys!"

Published in them is information that could compromises the security of the U.S., causing Fay to first head to Paris to fetch them ...","Fay Grim is told on his face a story of espionage and intrigue with a nod and a wink. Continuing his extraordinary Henry Fool, Hal Hartley creates a startling mix of film noir and hardened spy thriller that starts with a knowing smile and a big dose of laughter and turns as poignant and warm as any movie I've seen this year is Parkey Posey Fay Grim, an ignorant Mata Hari, caught between the love of her ex-husband Henry Fool and the questionable intentions of a charming CIA agent. As Agent Fulbright, Jeff Goldblum is a master of wit and sarcasm, in a role that seems tailored to his talents. He has never been better. James Urbaniak is Fay's brother Simon, imprisoned but famous for his wildly popular poetry books. His love for his work and his sister brings with it a passion to contrast the sullen nature of the spies that eventually populate Fay's world. And Liam Aiken is Fay's exuberant 14-year-old son. Although that may be superfluous. Aikens restrained style is remarkably ""old soul"" for someone his age. <br /> <br /> The whole movie is Dutch-turned, the off-kilter style famous by Orson Welles and used mostly in horror movies and psycho thrillers convey a sense of foreboding. In Fay Grim, it's fascinating to use the style from the opening credits to the end, in the next one deceptively clever. Because as the viewer falls for the perfectly timed comedic elements and the joke of Hartley's brilliant script, something happens. The film takes a dark but strangely reassuring turn as these characters magically become sympathetic before our eyes. What began as a dark comedy turns into a romantic drama and the transition is masterful. Slow pace is replaced by breathtaking action and we are sucked straight into the whirlpool. <br /> <br /> Hartley's keen dialogue combined with the astounding accomplishments of a perfectly matched ensemble ultimately creates a delicious movie cocktail. Said with the luxury of one who is able to write, produce, direct, edit, and even compose the music, Hal Hartley has created a clever, sexy story of spying with tongue just cracked in the cheek , Fay Grim is part of Dashiell Hammett, part Raymond Chandler, and part of Ian Fleming, shaken and perhaps also touched."

Sensing that they are developing a connection, Jesse asks Celine to spend the day with him in Vienna, and she agrees. So they pass the time before his scheduled flight the next morning together. How do two perfect strangers connect so intimately over the course of a single day? What is that special thing that bonds two people so strongly? As their bond turns to love, what will happen to them the next morning when Jesse flies away?","There are many notable things before Sunrise, almost too many to fit into a review like this, but suffice it to say that it is one of the most observant character studies of the nineties, perhaps even throughout the contemporary cinema, to avoid being attentive about love, per-say, as much as it is about a human connection. How do you fall in love at first sight? Nobody does that, at least that is the consensus that Linklater wants to show with his film. And yet, there is the possibility of such an intense connection, a bond that can be formed into the young, with many ideas that can be articulated and expressed with a breadth of cynicism while at the same time being very tender and true. Linklater tells us the story of Celine and Jessie, a Frenchman and an American boy, getting off the train to Vienna and talking about things on the way, at first arbitrarily, then personally (Jessie sees death for the first time in his life) great-grandfather). Jessie persuades Celine to come with him one night in the 'city' in Vienna, to his plane the next morning. <br /> <br /> Before Sunrise gives Jessie and Celine, in the middle of beautiful Vienna, sceneries and locations that deal with topics that are very important, and, to a certain extent, conversations about what it's like to watch people, the one in the other lead. These are often relationships and obligations, as Jessie and Celine tell stories that are sometimes inconsequential or apparent, and others that can say a lot about their essential qualities. We hear confessions of desires for other loved ones, or what is not really love, being part of a family or part of an education that may teach you how you love your life, what it means to believe or not believe in any religious form, or to have any connection to any belief and soul (I loved the tittle of the Quakers in the church), and sometimes laced with cynicism or skepticism. Jessie may be more responsible for this final part, but the fascinating thing about the film is that it's never cynical itself, just commenting on the cynicism that lies in the concerns of men and women at this age of their lives. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, it's always great to see Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy in those roles where they are not incessantly annoying in this 90's Generation X mode, but the people are, if not in the central one Imagination of the film, It's not bad, but necessary, you might think you have to run around in the streets of a city. The imagination is that of an old romantic picture ala Brief Encounter, only here the intimacy is expressed in the main characters, either among each other, where sweet trifles are actually acceptable (""I have to tell you a secret,"" says Jessie and then leans for a kiss, ho-ho), or in the little moments that appear on the way with other people. I loved the scene with the poet, where it's very cinematic to suddenly find a random romantic bit player in the midst of a romantic picture with such beautiful words, or with the palm reader and the reactions of Jessie and Celine that we could share but really see that they do it first-hand. Hawke and Delpy are intriguing the roles all the time - we can see neuroses already forming for their adult lives - as they can lead into the future ... <br /> <br /> With great cinematography and a script with an ear to the natural joke and a true sense of what it means to have a moment of bliss, however, in itself, how it can lead to something more. Who can say that you can not suddenly be attached to someone, if only for less than 24 hours, and so much more connected than a couple? Maybe that's Linklater's thesis, but there's more to it than that. It's a very dense movie, and I'll keep calling it. A scene that is both cheesy and brilliant is that when the two speak in front of each other ""on the phone"" and mimic their representations, they might come to each other's friend. A +"

It's almost two hours long, there are absolutely no stars, there are subtitles, but still it's interesting and exciting to see. What impressed me most was the realism of the film. You could almost feel the cold of the ice, because you could see that the storms are real. This is a relief in a CGI world like today. I wondered how much work that had to be for Van Dyke. I read somewhere that it took 17 months to film it. Who wants to talk about Titanic again?

Growing up a social misfit in poverty, Little Richard's passion, talent and flamboyance catapulted him into the limelight of rock music. His career was rocked by his homosexuality, his fundamental beliefs and the pervasive discrimination within the music industry. We go through his chart-topping years when he lived the quintessential Rock and Roll life, indulging in all-night orgies and the spiritual callings that pulled him in and out of the music industry. But as alcohol and drug addition plagued his career in the late 1960s, Little Richard makes the life-saving decision to return to his family. Through their love and strength, and Little Richard's resolve, he moves on in history to become one of the most memorable performers in rock and roll.","I know that the true story of Little Richard is more exciting than this maudlin and thoroughly average biopic.

9,tt0389326,1,"A semiserious, often rollicking, multigenerational insider's look at the origins of surfing, the colorful and subversive birth of surf culture, and the mythology and lure of the big wave. This passionate and fluid film is without question the first authentic history of surfing from its humble Hawaiian beginnings to the big business it became to the still-rebellious universe it inhabits today. Riding Giants is a study in individuality and freedom, the pursuit and techniques of pure kinetic pleasure, and the risk taking and attitudes that characterize its leading figures. For some viewers, this is perhaps more than they ever wanted to know. But Peralta's detailed knowledge of the surfing lifestyle, its icons and locations, its boom and exploitation by the media, and the fascination it has held for young men for more than five decades is unparalleled and fuels this expedition for the expert and initiate alike. Closely chronicling the sometimes-life-and-death drama that big-wave riding ...","I found out a few days ago that the creators of this movie have made a pun on the title. This film is not primarily about the ""giant ride"", but especially about the giants of the sport, RINGING gigents, to shift the focus. <br /> <br /> In my youth, I lived one block off the wedge, one of the hardest and best bodysurfing spots in the world. I was surfing in 15 to 18 feet, and ridden and was hammered by 10 and 12 foot waves on many occasions. This experience makes me totally excited about the surfers in this movie. The idea that Jeff Clark, apparently a normal mortal, could get away with Mavericks BY HIMSELF for over a decade, is unattainable to me. The first safety rule of any water sport is ""Never surf / dive / swim alone"". He went where sensible people were not and lived to tell about it. I would not go out there if the water was 75 degrees and the sharks were all gone. <br /> <br /> In the world of warm water: the first shot of the waves in the Jaws always makes the skin tingle all over my body. These are not just scary waves, these are uncontrolled intestinal tides. If we see that Laird Hamilton not only survives waves of 40 to 60 feet (I can barely type these numbers), but I actually work faces like a fun day in Rincon, I'm blown away. There is a dedication and concentration in big-wave drivers that is comparable to that of anyone in the world. <br /> <br /> This is a great movie. I only gave it a 9 instead of a 10 because it does not mention that there are big big wave riders outside the Hamilton / Kalama crew, and I think they deserve to be mentioned. Splice in Ken Bradshaw outside Log Cabins and a 10's it!"

A woman assembles a circuit breaker, and women and children are seen picking through debris or playing in it. Burtynsky concludes with a visit to Shanghai, the world's fastest growing city, where wealth and poverty, high-rises and old neighborhoods are side by side.","I was very excited to see this movie and expected a visual digression on the relationship between artistic beauty and nature that contained the wisdom of ""Rivers and Tides"". I did not get that. Instead, I get a rather uninspired film about how human industry is bad for nature. This is clearly a rather unorthodox statement. <br /> <br /> The photographer seems to occasionally populate the images about the aesthetic qualities of his paintings and the supposed ""ethical"" duty he has towards the workers, along the periphery. And frankly, the pictures were generally not that impressive. And after this ""artist"" scale is the basis for what makes something beautiful. <br /> <br /> A stupid movie in every way.

Likewise, it is rare for me to gasp through the laughter in several scenes. The love story is a bit thin on the ground, but I would say that's probably the best, because this romantic comedy has the emphasis on ""comedy,"" and in any case, it just pushes the limits of credibility a little more than I like Most rom com's do. The four scientists have provided some of the funniest moments not just in this movie, but in every movie I've seen in a long time. I hesitated for a few moments until I finally chose a ""10"" over a ""9"" as a rating, as I believe that too many people use them indiscriminately and therefore lose the maximum rating of effectiveness. I'm also a big Meg Ryan fan who helps, but this is one of the few films I've seen that I would say is in the shade. She and Tim Robbins are the main characters, but for me they play the second fiddle against the antics of the awkward intellectuals. A really laughing loud movie."

I like to remember the late evenings I spent on the floor watching Body Snatchers and Martian Invaders and Blobs enter an unsuspecting society. There was a summer, in the early 1980s, when a local science museum (in Richmond, Virginia) held every weekend a classic of the nuclear age. These were 16mm movies, and most were black and white (and the projector was loud), and THE BLOB's ""color"" print had faded to a faint pink - but, man, it was funny.

The reader is asked to excuse my stronger vocabulary. <br /> <br /> Well, this movie is absolutely terrible, and I would never bother to write a single word about it, if it were not for ""44 minutes"" it got me sick, which rarely happens to me. The fact that I paid for it does not make me any better, as does the fact that the film deserves the high user rating here. <br /> <br /> So what's up with the movie? It has a fashionable title - ""44 minutes"". One thinks first of ""fifteen minutes,"" which by the way is a much better movie, but still bad in my book, and in fact the two can be compared to some degree. But as luck would have it, the things they share are their worst qualities. In both plays Mr. Oleg Taktarov, who obviously fulfills the expectations and prejudices of the population with his strong Russian accent. Its purpose is to appeal to the spirit of the Cold War. Ah, we miss the good old days. Well, I do not suppose that he is a bad actor, I still have to judge his true performance, but he's just not a real human here, he's more like an archetype. How one can indulge in such things is completely beyond my comprehension. We can detect here modern American xenophobia. The point in the film in which Taktarov tells his companion that Romanians are not Germans and that they are in America is really ridiculous. Should we assume that the miserable duo's biggest wish is to become ""real"" Americans? <br /> <br /> Then there is the media problem. Yes, it seems that most of what we learn comes from cameras, interviews and reporters. The director should let us feel the rhythm of the alleged 44 minutes. Instead, he bores us throughout the movie with interviews like in a cheap TV show and tries to reinvent the wheel. In 15 minutes, the topic of the media is the central theme. The point is presented as a teacher addressing a blunt student, but that deserves a separate comment, we are now focusing on 44 minutes. So I tried to identify the purpose of this movie. What is it? To give the audience a good time? To glorify weapons? To glorify the police? Violence? Oh yes, the officer gives the underage delinquent the Bible. So it has to promote peace and understanding? I do not think so, but do not ask me. All I know is that I did not like that. <br /> <br /> Ah, Michael Madsen. I admit, I'm a big fan. I hoped he was a good point, but I was wrong. It is not his fault though. <br /> <br /> As a final comment, the comparison of ""firepower"" and ""willpower"" at the end of the film was one of the worst lines I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> In summary, on the scale 1-10, I give a pure, unadulterated 1."

Mr. Katzir, a former officer and paratrooper intimately reveals his loves story with Iris, a charming girl about to begin her army service. A truly poetic film filled with beauty innocence and wisdom. This film is also an important historic document with rare and shocking footage from the era of assasinated prime minister Yitzchak Rabin.

Pete Garrison (Michael Douglas) is a veteran Secret Service agent who has had a long and distinguished career helping protect the president of the United States. David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland) is a fellow Secret Service agent who learned most of what he knows from Garrison and holds him in great respect. When intelligence data suggests that there is a mole within the Secret Service who is part of a plot to assassinate President Ballentine (David Rasche), Garrison launches an investigation to ferret out the rogue agent, and asks Breckinridge to go over the evidence with a fine-toothed comb. Breckinridge is shocked when the clues point to Garrison as the traitor within the Secret Service, but his sense of duty compels him to see that his former mentor is placed under arrest. Garrison eludes his captors and struggles to prove his innocence while tracking down...","SPOILER ALERT! ! !

Most of them have their elements of silliness, the postponed wedding and so on. However, this has an endless series of events that take place in the near dark as the characters move from one place to another. The house seems more like a city. There is also Leo G. Carrol, who is such an obvious suspect nobody seems to see. He is a stranger and behaves quite suspicious, but Drummond and the people seem to pick up nothing. Still, it's a pretty good action and a pretty good ending. <br /> <br /> I know that Algie is supposed to be a cartoon character, but like Nigel Bruce in the Rathbone Sherlock Holmes flicks, he's so arrogant that it's hard to imagine anyone with taste or intelligence around him. Is there a story behind him that will explain how he and Drummond became associates?"

When Norman finally returns, the siblings resume their fishing outings, and assess both where they've been and where they're going.","The combination of reading Novella and watching this movie inspired my wife and me to new levels. Recently, I thought about a statement by artist Thomas Kinkade in one of his inspiring books; He says, ""You and I were not designed to breathe the stinking air of five o'clock traffic, nor do I believe that God had banal TV programs, media hype, worthless purchases, and soul pollution in mind when he created the universe. ""I had not seen a river flow in a few years,"" but after thinking about Kinkade's statement, I was made to look at the movie with a spiritual look, I saw it, and a whole new world for myself seen the movie and it inspired me to read the book (a must) I was always frustrated in Southern California but somehow trapped in its materialistic society, the film really puts into perspective the way we should really experience God's creations. A combination of Maclean's story and my desire to move back to the Northwest has made me move to Montana, I want my future kin who are able to tour the countryside, go fly fishing with me, ride horses in nothing but open country and calm lakes in the mountains. A place where you rarely worry about crime. I look around in SoCal, and all I see are shopping malls, rude, growling people in their Mercedez Bens, miles of congested highway vehicles, gangs, race riots on the verge of a violent eruption, and all skeptical of others' intentions. Anyway, the movie is very inspiring with brilliant acting and a deep story about the fragile connections of loved ones. Much thought is made in this film. The landscape alone is worth seeing and actually helps to reduce tensions. You should end this movie relaxed and full of insights on your own life. It takes a compassionate, intelligent and spiritual person to truly grasp the meaning. If you do not understand the art of cinema and how a director achieves his goals through dialogue, sound, light, color, scenery, camera angle / movement, and so on. Then this movie is probably not for the crowd who thinks ""The Fast and The Furious"" is the biggest movie. Granted, it was entertaining, but shallow. <br /> <br /> Conclusion: This film helps to realize that life is not about how much money you have or what you own. Rather, it's about your relationships with family and friends and the experiences you share together. QUALITY NOT QUALITY"

8,tt0014672,1,"The first half of the film portrays the struggle of the under-armed, under-manned colonists against the British Redcoats at Lexington, Bunker Hill and Valley Forge. Other landmarks of the American Revolution shown include the Boston Tea Party, Paul Revere's midnight ride and Patrick Henry's (played by Frank McGlyyn Jr. and not played by his father Frank McGlynn Sr) inflammatory speeches to the VIrginia House of Burgesses. The second half dwells on the bloody Indian War of Mohawk Valley. THe parts are tied together by the troubled romance between a young patriot, Nathan Holden (<a href=""/name/nm2315785?ref_=tt_stry_pl"">Neal Hamilton</a>)and Nancy Montague (<a href=""/name/nm0218781?ref_=tt_stry_pl"">Carol Dempster</a>), the daughter of a Tory Judge.","I waited until July 4 to write this because. , , Well . , , because it just feels right to do it that day. <br /> <br /> 1924 D.W. Griffith needed a hit, he had not had much since ORPHANS OF THE STORM (1921). Since then he has worked steadily, but his films were smaller and had failed to hit the right note in the audience. He was planning a film about Patrick Henry when he was contacted by members of the ""Daughters of the American Revolution"" (DAR) who asked if he could broaden his ideas to include more of the American Revolution. This movie is the result. When he was done, he had a 14-reel history lesson and Patrick Henry was nowhere to be seen. <br /> <br /> We all know the story of the Revolutionary War, but Griffith threw a love story with him Patriot Farmer Nathan (Neil Hamilton) falls in love with Tory aristocrat Nancy Montague (Carol Dempster, a leading lady for Griffith for many years ). To make matters worse, Nancy's father hates Nathan. , , Good, not only Nathan, he hates all the rebels. It does not help if someone bumps Nathan's arm during a battle on the streets of Lexington, causing him to unload his gun and accidentally hurt Nancy's father! <br /> <br /> The love story is the paralelling (mostly correct, but partially embellished) History of Capt. Walter Butler (Lionel Barrymore) a renegade British officer who feels that he owes no one loyalty. With thousands of Indians forming the Six Nations on his side, he hopes to destroy the colonists and become the monarch of his own empire. <br /> <br /> Comparisons with BIRTH OF A NATION (1915) are inevitable. The Montague family might as well be the Camerons from the previous film, while Nathan could be part of the Stoneman family. The sequence of the Battle of Bunker Hill is very similar to a scene in BIRTH OF A NATION with the attacking army, in this case the Redcoats, storming a ditch full of patriots. The only thing missing is Henry Walthall driving through no man's land to stuff a flag into the cannon mouth. Amazingly, the fighting scenes in America seem to miss the energy of BIRTH's fight scenes and fail to engage the audience. Something is missing clearly. It is not a scope, G.W. ""Billy"" Bitzer's camerawork is pretty good. Maybe something is missing. , , I dare say. , , Sincerity? <br /> <br /> The brutality of Capt. Butler and his men are well underlined, though much of it happens in the long shot or offscreen. Do not expect any heads to be replaced in close-up, as we saw in INTOLERANCE (1916). In one scene, Butler's second command, Captain Hare (Louis Wolhiem) pierces the eyes of a captured colonist. For the rest, the camera focuses on Hares face as he obviously has a good time doing so. Lionel had worked with Griffith since 1912. One story says that he asked Griffith for work and D.W., who knew the reputation of his illustrious family, said, ""I do not hire stage actors."" Lionel replied, ""And I am nothing of the sort, sir."" He makes a very good and fairly credible villain. Louis Wolhiem appeared three times with Lionel's older brother John; in SHERLOCK HOLMES and DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE (both 1920) and later in THE TEMPEST (1927). As Captain Hare, his wild, staring eyes and disheveled hair not only mark him as a villain but also make him crazy. <br /> <br /> Neil Hamilton later remarked that America was on horseback for the first time and ""I was scared to death."" He hides his displeasure but very well and we can believe that he was quite equestrian when the shooting was over. Mr. Griffith was very much in love with Carol Dempster and eventually asked her if he wanted to marry him. She refused and soon left his corporation, after which her star status gradually weakened. <br /> <br /> Speaking of horses, an accidentally amusing moment that needed to be unofficial came during the presentation of Paul Reveres ride. He rides his horse directly onto a family's porch to announce, ""To the guns, the regulars are coming!"" but when he tries to leave the horse, he can not overcome the steps backwards and stumbles his rider to the ground! I am amazed that Griffith did not make another attempt. <br /> <br /> Is America a classic? YES! Do not wait for the 4th of July to see it, it is always pleasant."
3,tt0401711,0,"Paris, je t'aime is about the plurality of cinema in one mythic location: Paris, the City of Love. Twenty filmmakers have five minutes each; the audience must weave a single narrative out of twenty moments. The 20 moments are fused by transitional interstitial sequences and also via the introduction and epilogue. Each transition begins with the last shot of the previous film and ends with the first shot of the following film, extending the enchantment and the emotion of the previous segment, preparing the audience for a surprise, and providing a cohesive atmosphere. There's a reappearing mysterious character who is a witness to the Parisian life. A common theme of Paris and love fuses all.","Only a handful of the segments are involved here. A segment with a workshop supervisor from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent & Bob Hoskins makes sense Twist by Twist until the last shot drowns things out. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips call Paris. The others are so scattered in theme, tone, willpower and production that you can also see ""The Years Best Commercials, 2006"". It is really everywhere. It does not develop over its term, and nothing rules the directors. No construct successfully connects the pieces ... boredom sets in. I'm at the hour, twenty minutes and Elijah Wood is in some stupidity, over - commercial, over-produced vampire Shtick. It has about as much to do with Paris as old ladies knitting in the Antarctic. Fantasy turns up, I think first in the Coen Brothers segment (Uh, thank J & E for ruining another movie) and then makes far too many appearances. The point of being in Paris is that you do not need fake crap to make your days extraordinary. Why divide it into neighborhoods when Quartier de la Madeleine is equated with vampires for a loser director? Was a genre ever over-represented as the vampire movie? Every three years we get the same lame vampire clichés. Worse yet, the change from segment to segment is pretty artless. The transitions are lost. This does not feel like it's going to be sloppy."

8,tt0194218,1,"Alex, a sad-eyed mournful man, goes into psychotherapy: he discloses he's a hit man. He also tells the doctor, after a few sessions, that he's attracted to a young woman he's met in the waiting room. She's Sarah, 23, quick, edgy, and perhaps attracted to him as well. But he's married, the dutiful father of a young precocious boy, so Sarah brushes him off. In flashbacks we see him get his start as a killer, at his father's prompting: it's the family business. Dad gives Alex his next assignment: to kill the therapist. Alex keeps returning to Sarah, calling her, stopping by her apartment, as he decides what to do about the hit, his father, his marriage, and his malaise.","It's easy enough to see why Panic never got a good cinematic look: it's far too clever, and the audience would probably have had a hard time comparing it to American Beauty in his exploratory midlife crisis and Sopranos and Analyze This in his Study illegal activity in family life. Although Panic seems to come from unoriginal material, Brommel's lifelike characters, coupled with skilful dialogue and attentive directing, make the film a realistic look at the demise of a middle-aged man. William H. Macy plays the lead role as Alex, a contract killer who works for his father's (Sutherland) contract business. He leads a double life, with his wife (Ullman) and his son unaware of his real business. In his middle age, he becomes increasingly disgusted by what he has done all his life. Beneath his quiet, clogged facade, resentment against his father's controlling grip on his life frightened him. When he meets a young woman (Campbell), he feels inspired and decides that it's time to give up the family business. <br /> <br /> The fact that writer / director Henry Brommel chose to make the profession his main character was trying to break away from contract killing is disposable. He could easily have replaced it with some unwanted occupation; His characters are so well developed and believable, scenes so smoothly and realistically handled, and dialogues so insightful and naturally written that the focus is more on Macy's contradictory character than on his job as a killer. Brommel's script feels like a Shakespearean tragedy, with a certain theme of fate. <br /> <br /> In Macy, Macy creates a tragic, slightly likeable character and always delivers a brooding, great performance, as you would expect. Donald Sutherland is also effectively repugnant and offensive as his arrogant father, and Ullman's dramatic turn as Macy's wife is a welcome change for the comedian. Consider a scene in a bicycle shop, where her mood is subtly darkened and stands out in a poignant scene of emotional confusion. <br /> <br /> Henry Brommel's first film Panic is a film well done in its sincerity. With a top-notch cast, a plausible script, tight dialogues, and a nice direction, this character study will hopefully just be a foretaste of Brommel's ability to create characters that seem real. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10"

William Powell reportedly had plenty of time to work with Miss Arthur, but you would never know it from the end result; they are clumsy next to each other and hesitate because of their teasing.

Both films have a vague, vague quality, along with intricate meanings and characters. Frechette was as ruthless in person as his character was in this film. A few years after making Zabriski Point, Frechette deprives a bank in real life. During his term, Mark died an unworthy death. He was killed by a 150 pound weight that fell on him when he was lifting weights. <br /> <br /> The best thing about this movie was the great cinematography and special visual effects. The incredible slow motion scenes of debris floating in the air after a blast were a stroke of genius. Although Zabriski Point was not as groundbreaking as Easy Rider, he still found resonance in the counterculture of the early 1970s. I recommend it for those who like avant-garde films showing the upheaval, the youth rebellion in the early 70s."

Since I had no idea what it was all about, it took a lot of time because it can not take any punches and what we see is how life changes through the act of an angry young man who decided to bully his classmates who are the innocent victims of his hasty actions. <br /> <br /> Paul Ryan, the director who edits and edits his own material, is a talented man rewarded with an incredible acting by his cast. <br /> <br /> Alicia Browning is an older girl trying to graduate from high school. She has been away for several years and does not seem to be in the same wavelength as the other students. For one thing, she is a rebel with a punk look, lots of makeup and a mouth that will cut anyone who dares to come near her. Alicia was among the students in the home room, where nine students have died, allegedly killed by her friend. Alicia, we realize, is an injured girl who has suffered a terrible ordeal in her life, but we have no clues to this effect. <br /> <br /> What follows is the aftermath of the tragedy as it focuses on a young woman who has survived it. Deanna Cartwright is a wealthy teenager who should not have been in school at all. When a ricochet hit her, she was hospitalized with more than one wound. She tries to overcome this dark period in her mind, but the nightmares do not let her forget her. <br /> <br /> Alicia is taken to the hospital by the Headmaster. Since she does not cooperate with the police, the headmistress wants her to see Deanna in her dreadful condition, and maybe she'll get softer and tell the authorities what she knows. Alicia does not like Deanna, but in a few days both girls will make peace. We only know in the last sequence what really happened on that terrible day at school. <br /> <br /> Busy Phillips is an excellent Alicia and Erika Christiansen is as good as Deanna. Victor Garber, James Pinkins, Taylor Holland and the rest of the cast play as an ensemble. <br /> <br /> The film has an intensity because it does not explicitly show how it came to filming, what the tone of Mr Ryan wanted to give this movie."

Yes, it should be a slap stick, stupid comedy, but the screen writers have no idea what the movie was about. Even the title does not fit the movie.

He has made hundreds of films, many of which are crap. However, he managed to sneak occasional quality work throughout the assembly line production. ""Succubus"" is not his best work (either ""The diabolical Dr. Z"" or ""Vampyros Lesbos""), but it has many of its brands that make it a must-have for anyone who is interested in plunging into his large catalog , He combines the erotic (alternating between frontal nudity and something left to the imagination) and the surreal seamlessly. This is a very dreamy movie full of atmosphere. I particularly liked the constant name dropping. Although it sounds incredibly upbeat, listening to all of Franco's influences is amusing. <br /> <br /> However, there are many users who do not like ""succubus"" and I can see where they come from. It's cozy, but I can handle it. More problematic is the incoherence. The script here was obviously rash, and within five minutes of the movie, I had absolutely no idea what was going on (and from that point on it never really came together). For those who want something with their style, look elsewhere. Even if it's a horror movie, it never gets really scary or even exciting.

Belushi has a lazy 35th birthday. He did not get his Wheaties, his coffee and lost his job. The maker is when his self-described ""big blue piece sh **"" car collapses at the end of the day. He goes to an empty bar to call for a tow truck. While waiting, he is recognized by the bartender (Caine) as the boy who lost the city's baseball game 20 years ago. That makes him think what life would have been like if he had won the game. He finds out that Caine unknowingly serves a potion in a jar that gives him a mansion, the Ball Queen (Russo) as his wife, and makes him president of the sporting goods company he's been puked out of. Caine later reveals himself as the one responsible for the change, but Belushi is not on board. He never completely adapts, and in an action that does not kill the movie, but is still strange, he tries to protect his wife (Hamilton) from his real life, which is now married to someone else. The good move is that they do not spend too much time with it, because basically they are ripping ""Ghost"" while Belushi Hamilton keeps telling things she just knows. It also brings a hokey dramatic element, as two of his lovers in the shadows, new wife Russo and his unbalanced lover Cox kevetch. But the keys to the film are the somewhat lengthy beginning and the happy ending. Also good work from the large and recognizable cast, as Belushi is very personable, VERY attractive ladies are chosen, and Caine is quite loose as a hero on the way. Strangely, this was Belushi's second film of 1990, which dealt with gaining an alternative lifestyle of wealth found in Taking Care of Business. Although both films are similar, they are at the same level of laughter. So check it out for an entertaining discovery of ""what if?"""

The story is not a documentation of the 1974 revolution in Portugal. But it gives us an idea of ​​how it was. The fiction of the story is not of great interest, but it does not spoil the movie.

Captain Salgueiro Maia remains one of the greatest heroes of the April 25th revolution. <br /> <br /> All actors are very good and even the smallest roles are played wonderfully.

I really can not remember another war movie, I'll capture you so, change your existing view of history and politics, restore your belief in humanity. After seeing so many killings, so many woes, you do not feel numb, instead you value the connection between people more.

This movie has incredible special effects, a true epic story, complex interaction with great characters and breathtaking battles - they must be seen to be believed! The only complaint I have is the subtitles on the HK DVD version that I got (some lines were not translated - ???). <br /> <br /> I just do not understand when I read from different sources and hear, ""It has a confusing plot ...."", ""I could not follow the story ...."" or ""Characters came out of nothing ... "". From the first time I saw this movie, I understood it, followed it, knew why characters were there, and I totally loved it! I've seen it 8 times and every time it's pure enjoyment. Oh, and that's not just my opinion, because I showed this movie to many fellow Americans (people who have never seen a HK movie before) who think the same way. None of them could not follow the story and each person declared their love for this film. Oh man, why can not we have something like Hollywood? At least Lord of the Rings had a nice combination of special effects, character development and storyline. <br /> <br /> This is not from an Asian movie lover newcomer. I own an extensive library of Asian films and I have to say that this movie is one of my biggest DVDs. If you look at it, you'll be overwhelmed by the amazing special effects and epic feel of this movie. You will be drawn into this fantasy world and you will not want to go! I have seen both the 1983 version and the 2001 version (both from Tsui Hark), and in 2001 IMO is much better. <br /> <br /> In addition to the subtitles, I have another complaint about this movie: I did not want it to stop ....

This movie Noir looks and plays like a cheap programmer and never achieves anything special. It's nice enough, but eventually it stops making sense, and the mystery solution provokes one of those great ""give me a break"" reactions.

I'm sure when Jane Austen wrote the book, she made it several pages long, filled it with description, and did not suggest that people would read in one day, or it could pull and lose its appeal, which ""Emma"" certainly did Has. Now, ""Sense and Sensibility"" had this slow speed error, but at least it had vivid lines to make up for it, as well as some good performances! <br /> <br /> This brings me to Bug # 2, that's the acting, of course. Although I do not really care about anyone involved in this movie, I'm sure they're capable of good work, but I did not see much of it in this movie. It was as if people were trying too hard to be funny, too hard to be ""upper class"", too hard to be British (well, some of them), so they all act as actors and did not go out as people. <br /> <br /> # 3. The cast, as I said, just seemed like actors and not really like the people who played them. Maybe that's a good thing, because the people who played them were really not that nice. Why did everyone like Emma, ​​for example? Sure, she was nice to the rich, handsome people in front of them, but she was a terrible gossip behind her back. When her friends were ""ugly,"" she did not even care to be behind her back. So, why is this girl so great? Why do people have to tell stories, ""just to make them laugh?"" Of course, the snob could not do it right. I have enough problems with Gwyneth Paltrow as Gwyneth Paltrow, and her ""Emma"" has not exactly changed my mind. <br /> <br /> Well, it's easy to see that I did not care about this.

He does not love Susan, but she will make something of him the family expects. Arthur proposes but then meets a girl with no money who he could easily fall in love with.","Excellent comedy by Dudley Moore with support from Liza Minnelli and good-talk John Gielgud. Moore is Arthur, a man of a multi-millionaire family who would earn $ 750 million, provided he marries a woman (Susan) from another multimillionaire family. In principle, Arthur accepted the terms, but eventually he declined when he met the cute and poor Linda Marolla (Liza Minneli). Arthur was just a parasite because he did not work, he just enjoyed drinking hard and having fun with prostitutes. After some serious thought in his life and for the first time, Arthur decided to marry Susan just minutes before her wedding. The end was happy for Linda and Arthur, although he knew his life would change in the future. This comedy is a good life lesson for everyone. Rich people are usually not happy with their ways of life."

While Ben's wife and his three sisters try to find her, Ben takes Sam on a day trip to see a farmhouse that's for sale. The day trip turns into a road trip while dad and son explore their past, their relationship, and why Sam's wife might have left him. The road trip includes fishing, drinking, playing pool, sleeping under the stars, and frank discussion. Anger simmers close at hand, as do love and hope. Where Sam's wife is - and why she left - leads to the movie's resolution.","I have two good things to say about this film: The scenery is beautiful and Peter Falk gives a good idea (considering what he had to work with in terms of dialogue and direction). However, I found this movie extremely tiring. Drying paint would have been more fun. It seemed much longer than 97 minutes. Starting with the opening sequence, where everyone talks and Paul Reiser repeats everything he's been told on the phone, the movie is annoying. The film is filled with clichés and shticks, not to mention endless incidents of audible flatulence from Falk. Also, the director seems to have had difficulty deciding whether to aim for laughter or tears. There are some sequences that touch, but they are all played laugh. If you speak ""schmackig, sentimental and"" cute "", you will love it, but if you hope for something with more substance, look at another film."

It is very well played by the always good Brooke Adams and B-movie star James Karen, although the supporting actors are pretty average for a B-grader. The music, especially Gary Numan, is also good. Henry Dominic's script is quite intelligent for these kinds of things, though there is a hint of misogyny. Rodman Fender's direction is only appropriate, and there are some unnecessary cheap horrors.

Unfortunately, the resulting film - which, according to the ads, was ""nine times more exciting"" than ""Bird"" - is a disappointing successor, impeccably photographed and stylishly executed, but too tough and aimless for general consumption. <br /> <br /> Malden and Franciscus are very well represented in sympathetic roles, and cinematographer Enrico Menczer (DE DEAD IS ALIVE) uses the wide Cromoscope frame to transport the high-tech world in which Argento's bleak scenario unfolds, but the subplot with Euro-star Catherine Spaak (DER LIBERTIN) as a romantic interest of Franciscus means little more than unnecessary padding. Highlights include an unforgettable encounter with the black-gloved assassin in a crowded train station (edited with an elegant affirmation of the cult film Franco Fraticelli) and a nighttime episode in which Malden and Franciscus seek and find an important clue in a spooky grave the devious machinations of the murderer. But despite these flashes of light, the film races aimlessly from one scene to the next, simmering gently, without ever really getting to the boil.

To make matters worse, the quirky inhabitants mistake Friedrich for Frido the Tellyhobbie. Before he can say Tolkien, he's on a mission to save the world from an evil wizard who wants to dip the whole planet in one huge sizzling Swiss cheese fondue. A mission so crazy... it just might wake the hero in him. In the tradition of Scary Movie, THE RING THING is a spoof of the Ring Trilogy, topped off with the funny peculiarities of Switzerland.","It was considered the ""Swiss Answer to the Lord of the Rings"", but it's much more than that. It's not an answer to anything, it's something new, something funny, and sometimes it's very stupid and silly - but it was Monty Python other than silly? <br /> <br /> The beginning immediately makes the statement that this movie is low budget and should not be taken very seriously. Pappwolken on strings knock into the airplane, in which the main figure sits. But to compensate for the missing special effects, the landscape is the right one. It's absolutely beautiful and breathtaking - who needs New Zealand, Switzerland has it all. <br /> <br /> What I liked about the movie was the simple approach and the obvious passion and energy behind it. It is not brilliant; Still, it has some good humorous roles. Edward Piccin as Friedo is absolutely convincing, it would be enough to watch the movie because of him! There are some good jokes, some are very lame, some are not understood by people outside of Switzerland. I liked the idea of ​​having Urukows instead of Uruk Hai; I loved the scene where Friedo decides to take ""Pupsi"", a telehobbie, on the journey. The scene in which Rackaroll, the swordsman decides to demonstrate with his sword - and then hits him in a wall and breaks it is also very funny. And there's this one scene where the ""Nazgul-isch"" characters make a wonderfully funny scene containing a toilet brush ... I disagreed with the idea that Schleimli's ring, the ""Gollum"" character in order to ""seduce"" the ladies. That was a bit far-fetched. The idea that Lord Saurau wanted to cover the grounds with fondue was not so brilliant either. Original, sure, but not brilliant. But most of all, I did not like the idea of ​​a gay dragon, which was really not necessary. All in all, I recommend watching the movie because it is so crazy and totally trashy. Do not expect a LotR parody like ""Spaceballs"" for Star Wars. But if you go to the movies and think that this is going to be an amusing evening, with absolutely no ambitions, then you will enjoy it. I'm not sure if it works in other languages ​​because it lives on the Swiss dialects as well as the jokes and actors. <br /> <br /> All in all: Hats off to the courage of the Swiss crew, did this!"

It will deteriorate in a matter of minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your sense of shame for the actors to such an extent that you will probably not be pleased to witness. <br /> <br /> In an interview, I heard that the director in this film wanted to express the sense of identity loss experienced by the majority of people in this globalized world. I was amazed to hear that. Am I living in the same world he lives in? OK, a lot of people walk around in the same clothes as mine and listen to the same music, but that does not make me believe that I'm losing my identity.

New York's Deputy Mayor, Kevin Calhoun starts digging for information.","The film is about a classic theme. In fact, it is the subject exploited by Batman from beginning to end, but in real data and details. The mayor of New York, appreciated and very hard-working and dynamic to get through some project a little faster than normal, gives some pressure from some private entrepreneurs about a criminal drug dealer who should have been sent to jail and he puts pressure on the judge himself to release him on probation, despite a negative probation report that disappears, but is not destroyed, if only because of the political value he represents. And what will happen happens and a few people, including a black student, are killed in a shootout between a police detective and this criminal. The city could explode because of racial stress because of the black schoolboy and social tensions because of the insecurity that such criminals can roam around and continue with their criminal activities, they present to the public. Unfortunately, the film does not show this tension very well and follows the investigation of the first deputy mayor who wants to find out the truth and find out. But on the way, a few witnesses are killed, and those who have played a role in the whole thing are forced to retire (the judge) to their careers and their lives (the contractor or the contractor in between), a public one Ending officer was ready to deliver the missing probation report, and some dodgy figures, after he had delivered some important information. The mayor himself withdraws and makes a long vacation; But the main interest of the film is in exploring the contortions that the mayor is doing to cover up the problem and the dislocations he has remembered in the past that have led to the mistake of this probation case. The political philosophy that nothing is pure white or pure black and that everything is gray that decision makers do not like is cited as an excuse for making wrong but profitable decisions. We do not talk about necessary compromises in order to reach consensus in some areas of vital public interest. We talk about making it less important to make a bad decision about a small or supposedly petty criminal than about an infrastructure or economic project in the city. That's not typical of New York. That's true in every mayor's office. In a big metropolis like New York, and of course in a city or a country where police authorities are municipal authorities and controlled by political imperatives, it's quantitatively and qualitatively significant. The young Deputy Mayor pushes the old mayor out of the way and discourages his ambition to become governor of New York to become president of the United States. The mayor is perfect because of the embodiment that Al Pacino offers us, as he can express ten minutes of dialogue with a facial expression that makes the whole dialogue useless. I find the end slightly mushy with the ex-deputy mayor who fights in his own name. This seems to mean that he was so attached to justice because he saw his chance to push the mayor from his own side. Therefore, he is no better than anyone else, only too young in his ambitions. <br /> <br /> Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine, University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University of Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"

Well, I do not know anybody, and I've seen the last cut, and it's pure garbage. The only thing that leads to it are ambition and several cameos of horror legends (not terribly long on the screen). It's as if the filmmakers filmed this movie during a horror convention weekend, and made actors like Tony Todd, Tom Savini, David Hess, and Michael Berryman shoot scenes in their coffee breaks. This is an ultra-cheap, shot-on-video would-be X-Files with terrible actors from a cast of non-actors with more mullets than is acceptable in the 21st century. There is little or nothing; It's all overly explanatory dialogues trying to explain a meaninglessly complicated plot. Their computer FX are a joke, but there is not enough of them or enough action to make this movie entertaining in an MST3K way.

It's not much, but apart from a few one-liners, it's all this movie has to offer ... enough said. <br /> <br /> This film is not only structurally impaired, characteristically undeveloped, predictable and poorly written, but also just bad. Even uncritical viewers will hate this movie with everything they have. It's so familiar that it's just not funny. <br /> <br /> How often does the same movie have to be about sports? Last year we saw the same material in ""Air Bud: Golden Receiver"", and as bad as that movie was, that's even worse. At least ""Air Bud"" was family-oriented. ""Major League Back to the Minors"" is too vulgar for a healthy family to see each other on a Sunday afternoon. It is too childish for adults. So who is this movie for? Young people? Old? People who are so desperate for entertainment that they would rent something like that? <br /> <br /> The film, like so many others, has a basic point: teamwork conquers everyone. Yes, it does, and what a great moral to prove. Too bad we've seen it so many times before and have so little talent and intelligence that their cheerleading men are in ballerina costumes. Where the silly announcers make their own ""buddy comedy routine"" and mumble a liner to themselves like ""suck you"", ""This fast ball for kids is timed with an hourglass,"" ""This guy dropped out of the ball for a while to find something lost - maybe it was his opinion, ""Someone needs a nap,"" and ""ever see a sunset as beautiful as this game."" Where the characters mean so little to each other that we never know them by name where the only warm talk scene about teamwork is so ignorant that it's almost funny. <br /> <br /> ""Major league back to the minors"" is so bad, it stays in the middle of a good final sequence. Team is on a comeback, they're about to win and - the power goes out - I thought for a minute that this piece of garbage had come to an end, but in fact his wrong last scene only adds to minutes at runtime Movie best It's basically a series of disjointed sketches that throw so many lazy jokes that it's not funny. There is another kind of funny dialogue line where a coach and a player talk to each other why a longtime outfielder is no longer wanted in this position. The trainer's answer: ""You are too old, too slow and too fat."" The reaction of the player is a dream. But this scene certainly does not make this movie remarkable and does not cost a penny of your money. <br /> <br /> So here's another terrible entree into this genre of film, another one that's condemned with its own scripture that has previously failed, and another that's so familiar that it's like Deja -Vu always shines. <br /> <br />"

Andy McDowell is not much of an actress in the beginning, but given the nonexistent ""plot"" (I even hate to call her action), she had no chance.

My disappointment was that the film was neither a comedy nor a perfect robbery movie. Ustinov is playing a little time crook just out of jail, putting his websites on a big American company in London. He bluffs past the cumbered CEO Karl Malden and Tech-Geek Newhart and pretends to be a computer expert and immediately plans the ""perfect raid"" part of the movie. To do this, he must pass a tamper-proof security system that protects the company's mainframe. And here is problem one. His perfect plan works only because everyone else in the movie is remarkably confident and stupid. His lame excuses are taken at face value, and that must be the only data center that does not bother with video cameras anywhere. The second problem is the robbery within the first 30 minutes of the film, which will rob the rest of the picture in dramatic tension. Unfortunately, Maggie Smith is misled as Ustinov's neighbor / secretary, who just can not keep a job. I love Maggie Smith, but she just seems to be too much here, too composed, the role is more of a crazy, physical comedian. In addition, Ustinov and Smith have no chemistry with each other, maybe it's the age difference, but the later romantic relationship, as free of genuine romance as it is, still gets a bit scary. Ustinov co-wrote the script, which was well meant at that time, but I found it unconventional, meandering and a sad waste of a great cast."

Since much has already been written about the film, it would be only appropriate to highlight some parts of the film that I personally loved. <br /> <br /> I think the point where Jesse and Celine made fake phone calls to their respective friends was a very smart way to tell each other what they needed each other through a trip that did not even last 24 hours , had to tell ... the curiosity of two people, both of whom had made the one infallible impression on the other, was treated very smartly ... <br /> <br /> On the plot in front, a romantic story working on pure Talking is not an easy task to accomplish. <br /> <br /> I believe in romantic films of such a taste, the characters are not clear even in the mind of the author and director. What the actors produce is what becomes of them. Right or wrong even the idea bearer would find it hard to justify ... becoming the character, the life the actor gives has to go beyond the instructions and the story ... here both actors are doing just the right job!

Although it did not follow the original plot (that's why I gave it 8 out of 10), it was still pretty good and that's probably a better story. <br /> <br /> As far as the car is concerned, the DJ's commentary on the Challenger at the end, driving into the bulldozers at 185 mph, is pretty unlikely (And if you look, the tachometer needle wobbled at 145-150) but although I do not have an engine in one of the opening scenes in which they show the engine, the original story had a charged Hemi, so it's possible. For those of you who say aerodynamics would not allow it, today's normally aspirated Chrysler 300C can go 168 mph, and if you look at this thing, going on a freeway with it, it's like a brick wall by the wind pushing at 70 mph.

7,tt0756648,1,"Riding her bicycle on her way to school, a dreamy, ten-year-old, red-haired farm girl decides to take a shortcut through a ruddy and luscious autumn forest, somewhere in the mountainous region of eastern France. Unexpectedly, the young girl encounters a bright-eyed red fox, however, the untamed wild animal flees in an instant, leaving her longing to meet again. Since then, a whole winter has passed and still no sign of the elusive fox, but with the arrival of spring, the girl determined to find the animal, finally locates its den and an ambitious effort to grow accustomed to each other begins. As we witness a succession of compelling scenes, lost inside the enchanting and breathlessly exquisite landscape, we observe the bond between a human and a savage animal grow gradually stronger, yet, a wish and question emerge. If only we, humans, could talk to the wild beasts, and if we could, could we ever become friends?","THE FOX AND THE CHILD is the latest film by MARCH THE PENGUINE filmmaker Frenchman Luc Jacquet. The film, which features only one human being, the young actress Bertille Noël-Bruneau, tells the story of the rather rare but seemingly believable relationship between a child and a wild fox. <br /> <br /> Natural documentary and part fairy tale, the film revolves around L'Infant, the child who one day finds the path of a wild fox in a picturesque setting, possibly France, on the way to school, though the exact location never is mentioned. In the next few weeks, the child returns to the place where she hopes her fox will see her on one of those days, the fox she calls Lily again. And so it continues. The days become weeks, and then the summer disappears, turns into autumn and winter and offers an excellent cinematography of the white winter landscape. At some point spring comes again, and the little child finds her fox, and in fact a friendship with the animal comes together. And so on. <br /> <br /> I had little to no expectations for THE FOX AND THE CHILD. I had seen PENGUIN FAIRY and was simply impressed with the movie that was included in this film. Luc Jacquet is an extremely talented and indeed rare filmmaker, and I expected great, breathtaking cinematography, sweeping vistas, and brilliant wildlife shots. This was delivered in spades. But here Jacquet has a scriptwriter, and before the show I did not know anything about the movie. I was expecting something a little different from what you had seen before in March. A fictitious story. <br /> <br /> The kid and the fox And the story is simple. A young, seemingly lonely child lives in a house in the middle of nowhere and goes to school, seemingly alone, every day seemingly without any care in a seemingly perfect world. Without the reference to an adult in sight. Brilliant. So she makes friends with a fox. <br /> <br /> With such a film, you have to give your own opinion about the film and put yourself in the role of the target group. This is a movie that is aimed directly at children over the age of six. Or for families who want to go to the cinema on a wet Sunday afternoon with their race. Not a 31-year-old man who gets his films from films like the last, brilliant WANTED and the like. But since I'm the Newbie critic in London, I put myself in the shoes of an excited eight-year-old girl for about 95 minutes of THE FOX AND THE CHILD. Now I have some problems with this movie. As a 31-year-old boy and a loyal lover of all things cinematic, I loved animal and landscape photography. It's visually stunning. The direction of the animal figures is brilliant - as good as you find it at Attenborough. As an impressionable, brief attention spanning eight years, I loved the first half hour - then I lost interest. It's a bit repetitive and sometimes quite shocking and scary for a younger kid, especially the darker ending. As a 31-year-old man - I was a little scared. Wuss. <br /> <br /> Well, it's not a kids movie. It's not really an adult movie and I felt a little disappointed. Is it a good family movie? Depends. It may be instructive and the movie carries a message. It's definitely not a movie I would pay the hard-earned green to see, and I rack my brains out to recommend it to a certain type of movie goer. It's hard, but I know that some will see this movie and fall in love. It's very European in feel and if you are a fan of wildlife issues, try it. Doubts? Well, I would wait for the DVD for a wet Sunday afternoon. - Paul Heath, http://www.thehollywoodnews.com, July 2008."

It certainly made me uncomfortable watching my very young children (most of them around 2 years old) frolicking and posing as adults - in this case, a dancehall girl and a bar-room fanatic. It's the kind of humor that you might have to laugh at from your own children if they pretend to be adults, but I can not see anyone who wants to see that - especially when a very young Shirley temple is dressed in a rather shabby way is outfit and behaves like a vamp! And then other children behave like adults in some more adult situations. I'm sure they did not try to appeal to pedophiles at the time, but when you look at it today, you realize it!

I did not believe that since Morgan Freeman and Kevin Spacey took roles in this movie and looked at them myself. Apparently they were right. I was really disappointed and wondered all the time during the movie - why the hell did I watch this movie? Of course, I did not expect much from Justin, as he really does not belong in the movie / theater business. But Morgan and Kevin? I could not stop wondering why the hell they agreed to attend Edison.

A group of men torture a girl for several days before finally killing her. And at this point I will say that these films are NOT real! They are fake horror movies trying to be as realistic as possible. <br /> <br /> The scenes are disgusting, but in many cases unrealistic. For example, when they kick the girl in the ground, we can clearly see her kick and stomp the floor next to the girl! And how stupid that looks! The sound effects are also unrealistic and make no sense. Other scenes include animal casts thrown at the girl, the girl who was exposed to loud noises for hours, the tearing of fingernails, worms on the wounds in the girl's body, the eye pierced and mutilated in horrific details. Very sick and mean movie and has absolutely nothing valuable or cinematic. This first entry is the sickest and most amateurish guinea pig, though it is not as bloody as the next part, flowers of flesh and blood that try to be as shocking as possible. <br /> <br /> Guinea Pig: Devil The experiment is perhaps the most blatant thing I've seen, and the closest thing to it is. Of course that's (of course) wrong (s / n), the only difference to the real ""snuff movie"" is that in this movie nobody dies or hurts. I can not recommend it to anyone as it is so dirty and repulsive. Anyone who considers this a great horror movie knows nothing about the cinema and its true meaning. I've seen that as a curiosity (like the other parts in the series) and now I know how trivial the garbage is. They only work in the shock level and that's not an all-too-valuable cinematic achievement. Devil's experiment is perhaps the sickest movie I've ever seen, and Mermaid in a Manhole (Guinea Pig 4) is perhaps the most disgusting movie I've seen.

It reminds me a lot of the old ""topper"" movies that were so good too. <br /> <br /> This film exposes popular but otherwise hackneyed movies like ""Ghost"" for the mediocre and overly sentimental manure festivals. We already know that public taste is heavily based on mediocrity. However, some of us save our praise for the really valuable ones. <br /> <br /> If you've enjoyed other overlooked gems like ""In the Night"" with Michelle Pfeiffer, Jeff Goldblum and Clu Gulager, ""Blind Date"" with Bruce Willis and Kim Basinger, ""American Dreamer"" with JoBeth Williams, ""Chances Are"" with Robert Downey Jr., Christopher McDonald and Cybil Sheppard, ""Making Mr. Right"" with John Malkovich, etc., you'll love it. <br /> <br /> A first-rate job all around (though it's hard to believe that a straight guy would pretend to be gay more than five years ago).

The characters speak in a stylized dialect that is obviously based on Yiddish idioms. Although the film's social attitudes and gender roles are outdated, it's all a lot of fun, and even the gentle joke of the Salvation Army is harmless and does not reflect a real aversion to organized religion.

It's annoying to watch the stereotypical Wallflower librarian take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid enough to win a man. Especially such a superficial and volatile man. He's obviously a player (I would not trust him to stay loyal to her) who does not want to settle down, who only looks at silly attractive women and always calls her ""baby"" (ick!). Even after she has completely changed her appearance and life for him, he only goes to her after being (allegedly) turned down by another woman and finds out that Connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him. I wanted her to resist him and not chase him pathetically! His sudden conversion within a few minutes was completely unrealistic and did not work for me. <br /> <br /> Apart from this subplot, I liked the movie. How can it not be that sailors dance together? (You can tell they came from San Francisco ....; D) The ""Probetal"" dance was great, watching Ginger Rogers as he purposefully stepped in and out of the ""right footsteps"" was great. The last dance scene ""Face the Music"" with beautiful costumes and Art Deco set was beautiful. And I really enjoyed ""We Saw the Sea"" (though they used it too many times too often, as if they realized that it was their best song). Anyway, the plot was a bit weak, like most musicals (IMO) - and the songs were OK, but dancing was worth watching. I wish they had been able to show a few shots of San Francisco as the movie was supposedly shot. <br /> <br /> It's also weird to see such a carefree marine movie, with the knowledge of what Hitler has been doing time. I must try to give up all knowledge in order to plunge myself into a fictitious fantasy land."

Barely able to stand sacking out at his noisy pal Jack's place, he finally finds new digs with Samantha, who only rooms with gay men. With currently no other place to live, Parker allows her mistake over his sexual orientation to pass uncorrected, which later leads her to believe she's helping him out by setting him up on dates with her gay friends. Truth is - he's falling hard for her, and somewhere between dealing with her philandering boyfriend and dating other men he needs to set the record straight.","Another insult and slap in the face for gay men everywhere.

And we are also introduced to the ""likeable, attractive"" homosexual friend, who is actually a fat, bald, ugly old man whom the line is supposed to find attractive. Also I did not find him appealing and I am a fat, ugly old gay man (but fortunately not bald)! Whatever theatrical talent is here, it was thrown away by a bad script and a really dreadful direction.

A headache? Lack of coherent writing? simple stupidity? Try all the above for this travesty. And that only for the direction. <br /> <br /> Story? Well, I think there is a story. Two dumb blondes are looking for a job after plunging a plane into a golf course. They are mistaken for a ""forgotten assassin"" (sarcasm) and hired by two ""mafiosi"". One thinks, ""taking him out"" means a date, and the other gets the little actor she dreams of.

Shooting sequences are not well done. I've seen better movies in Hong Kong movies. Visuals are average for a late 80s movie. But the problem is that it's a 2007 movie. <br /> <br /> Not worth my time to ever see this again. The movie ""Out"" by Danny Glover from the early 80s is still the worst movie of all time, but also this film is in a class of its own. ""F"""

I can not say anything bad about Peter Galleghar. He is one of my favorite actors. I love Anne Rice. I'm reading the vampire chronicles right now, but I'm glad I saw the movie before I read the book. That's a bit too ""real"" for me. I prefer Lestat and Louis' funny little Tiffs to the slavery battles.

This film is about a host of topics, not least of which is the hard-work involved in maintaining friendships.","""Someday we'll walk in the rays of a beautiful sun Someday, when the world is much brighter"" - The 5 steps ""Ooh Child"" <br /> <br /> films about black teenagers mostly refer to the inner city gangs who sell drugs or give up violence to a hip-hop soundtrack. Films about the everyday problems of ordinary teenagers in the city are hard to find, but there is an undiscovered gem that I would like to recommend. Jim McKay's song is about three girls in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, who learn that their high school is closed for asbestos removal and has to decide on its future direction, which may take separate paths. The story is told from the point of view of a 15-year-old, not an adult who remembers the past, as is the case in most coming-of-age movies. It avoids the obligatory street-length and excessive use of F-words, delivering an honest and loving portrait of three friends at a crossroad in their life. The girls: Lanisha (Kerry Washington), Joycelyn (Anna Simpson) and Maria (Melissa Martinez) are in their second year at the local high school. They are active members of Jackie Robinson Steppers, a true marching band whose rehearsals for a Labor Day parade provide discipline and purpose for their lives. <br /> <br /> Similar to George Washington's David Gordon Green, but less stylized, the film does not feature professional black and Latin American actors with Kerry Washington. While the performances have some amateurish moments, I was so busy with the story that I forgot that the girls were even acting. Maria, whose father is in prison, has learned that she is pregnant by Terrell, a local student. She wants to have the baby despite the fact that she is only 15 and knows that Terrell will probably not help much. Joycelyn works in an upscale boutique, but dreams of becoming a singer. In a very moving scene in her bedroom, she pretends to talk to her fans and then goes to bed to recite one of her poems. She is initially very close to Lanisha and Maria, but drifts off to find friends outside the neighborhood. None of the girls gets much support at home and Maria is too scared to tell her mother about her baby. Still, single mothers are not typical movie killers or alcoholics. They are warm and loving parents whose time is limited with their children because of the pressure to support the family. <br /> <br /> Lanisha's parents are divorced, but she can visit her father, a doorman in a luxury home, and talk about music. Her mother comforts when Lanisha learns that a friend in the neighborhood has committed suicide, a somewhat melodramatic storyline in an otherwise realistic film. When the summer is over, the girls drift apart and everyone decides on a different course. There are no big dramatic moments, but only the sad realization of the inevitability of change. Although we have no blinders to the frustrations they can expect, we identify with their hopes and dreams without embarking on the negative. Our song is an emotionally satisfying film about growing up in projects that refuse to see life in terms other than opportunity."

I saw it 4 months ago in my local theater. I saw it a second time and in the slow scenes I was a bit bored. Sid (the sloth) is not that flattering, but Diego (a mountain lion, I think) is really good in the movie. The animation is outstanding and the story has a touching ending. It's worth taking children under the age of 10, but teens would probably find it a bit boring. Also the uniqueness in the characters is so interesting.

If you knew how many times I went to the movies, you'd probably say that's hard to imagine, but still, it's true! After seeing the trailer for this movie, I knew I had to see it! If you are a fan of horror, mystery and tension, why not? The trailer is no less than fascinating and exciting; Unfortunately, the movie is none of this. <br /> <br /> From cinematography to screenplay to acting, this film is a complete flop. If you're reading this, planning to go to the movie for some thrills, mystery, action, horror, or anything but a waste of an hour and forty-five minutes, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. <Br /> <br /> Why is it so bad? You may ask. Let me tell you. The movie was neither mysterious nor exciting. Nothing about the movie made me at the least ""nervous,"" scared, or curious. The script was laughable at best. There were many times throughout the film where the dialogue was so ridiculous that I began to write it as a comic relief, only to find out a few seconds later that it was not. The acting was absolutely terrible. I like Nicholas Cage, but that was a miss. Without exception, every performance in this movie was unbelievably below average. The cinematography was terrible without a single moment of tension or mysticism. After all, the story is completely transparent. You can see that the end of this movie is a mile away. <br /> <br /> I'm usually not a very tough critic. Honestly, when I see a comedy, I want to laugh and when I see a mystery / tension / horror, I just want to be surprised.

I had never heard of the movie and had my concerns. As soon as I watched the box, I knew that the movie was an indie movie and therefore the quality would be less than a mainstream movie. <br /> <br /> I can tell you that after I finished Zero Day, I started right from the start. The film clearly followed the basics of what happened at Columbine High School in April 1999, but what struck me was how credible the two main characters were. When I saw this movie for the first time, I was not sure if what I was looking at was real tapes left behind by the shooters at Columbine. In the back of my mind, I knew that what I saw could not be real, but at the same time acting was so convincing that you had to keep shaking your head. <br /> <br /> Does the movie bother you? Absolute! Will you see things that make you question the merit of the film? Probably. I think what most people will find annoying is having feelings for the two main characters Calvin and Andre (played by Cal Robertson and Andre Keuck). Why is this problematic for some people? Calvin and Andre are planning a massacre at their high school. I know myself, I felt a tremendous sadness for Andre and Calvin. I had compassion for her because her life was so terrible. They had fallen so badly that they had begun a journey along a road that could have been stopped if only the people around them had noticed their distress. <br /> <br /> Zero Day is a phenomenal movie. It gives you a close and personal look at events that most of us will only see in the news. It makes you think about life. And it baffles you how people get to this point. One week after watching this movie, I think about it. <br /> <br /> For those of you who have not seen Zero Day yet, consider the following: The film is an independent movie with little to no budget shot on camcorders. The material in the film is disturbing. This is not mainstream Hollywood and there is no happy ending. <br /> <br /> But if you can put it all aside, Zero Day is a movie that can help you and maybe open your eyes a bit."

It easily combines half a dozen stories about the worst kind of depravity, perverted sex, greed, violence and intolerance. The whole action is played during a couple of very hot and sticky days during a heatwave in Vienna and the heat may be responsible for some of the anger and hatred in the movie. For me, the treatment of the backward girl by the security equipment vendor was the worst episode, closely followed by the scenes of drunkenness and perversity in the ""slag"" flat.

The characters are all as silly, innocent and charming as the songs of the Ramones, and of course the music itself is fantastic. High school comedies have really changed over the years comparing a movie like ""American Pie"" to this late '70s classic, where no tasteless sex jokes are made at all. Since a remake is obviously in the works, it can be expected that the charm of the original will be lost along the way and replaced by vulgar, half-witted dick jokes, as Bill Hicks called them.

There is not much new here ... it is just well done. <br /> <br /> Take care and pay attention, because the ""subtle"" horrors come fast and often. This is not a movie you can see when you eat pizza. <br /> <br /> There is a very well written red herring in this movie and unfortunately a very bad cast. Cheri Christian just does not make effective Julie (the wife / mother). For one, she is totally unsympathetic. I know, I know ... she has just had a traumatic experience. But the audience never learns to know as ""normal"", and the relationship between her and her husband's rather unpleasant (on unintentional way). I think the director meant that we have some sympathy for her, but I never did. <br /> <br /> Finally, a thumbs up for the end, which is both disturbing and satisfying. It could easily have been cheapened at the beginning of the credits with a sound effect, but the director wisely resisted. <br /> <br /> This is not a masterpiece, but it's a good, old-fashioned scary movie ... something that is rare these days."

Together, they have the same kind of joys and sorrows that just about every teenager has while growing up. This show parodied many of the attitudes, events and fads of the 70s, along with those who grew up at the time.","... and the series lets forget all that. I am about three years older than the children portrayed in the series. Born in 1958, I learned to drive during the first gas shortage and in 1979 got my first post-college final job during the second gas shortage. The 70s were a really terrible time to be young - inflation that rivaled the minimum of the school - daring jobs with laid-off thirties, horrible music, worse clothes. <br /> <br /> The funny thing is, this series ignores none of this and still manages to make fun of the 70's for those of us old enough to know better. It manages to face the 70's face-to-face with contemporary clothing-and yet fill the show with the hope of youth and the things that make high school and college time both the best and the worst. Then there are the parents. The two young lovers on the show - Eric Forman and Donna Piniotti - have really terrible parents with the best intentions. Eric's parents, Red and Kitty, are not exactly June and Ward, though they're conventional for the decade. They represent what happened when the 1960s reached the suburbs in the 1970s. Donna's parents are two people who have been waiting for the 1960s to show their lives to give their craziness legitimacy. Eric's friends Fez, Kelso and Jackie complete the group, which is nerdiness, well-intentioned incompetence and snobbery. Hyde is an unusual teenager for a suburban show, but for the most part he represents someone who has to play the cards he's got, even if those cards come from largely absent and negligent parents.

Once he's bought the house, bills and frustration pile up incessantly as anything that can go wrong with building Jim's ""dream house"" goes awry. <br /> <br /> One of three collaborations between Grant and Loy, this is a charming little comedy - not very exhausting, without really good news, but a great way to spend an hour or two. The laughs are there from the beginning, when the alarm rings and Jim tries to turn it off, just to defeat Muriel at every opportunity. The timing and delivery of the comedic lines and situations can only be given by a few experienced professionals, and that's what Grant and Loy give us: sophisticated performances, simple chemistry and lots of fun. Myrna Loy is in a pretty ungrateful role (it's obvious that Grant's character gets Jim the lion's share of the lines and acting and Grant, as always, subtracts both with remarkable serenity), but she gives Muriel a color, life and bite that only Myrna Loy can give a character. Melvyn Douglas also plays fun to perfection and never hits a single wrong note. <br /> <br /> One of my favorite scenes must definitely be when Bill locks up in the ""storeroom"" and Jim goes to ""rescue"" him ... just to capture everyone! Every little problem that comes up for Blandings' renovation project - including jealousy and a wham advertising campaign - seems to bring together everything that could go wrong with building a new home, but makes it believable and entertaining. 8.10"

I was about 9 years old. old and found this movie both very entertaining and very scary and unlike any other movie I had seen until that time. <br /> <br /> BASIC PLOT: An expedition is sent from Earth to the fourth planet of Altair, a great series star in the Aquilae constellation, to find out what happened to a colony of settlers that landed twenty years ago and since then no longer heard. TOPIC: An inferior civilization (namely ours) comes into contact with the remains of a far-advanced alien civilization that Krell - 200,000 years away. The ""seed"" of destruction from one civilization is passed on to another, unknowingly first. The theme of this movie is very good and evil. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie for the first time with my brother when he first came out. I was just a boy and the tiger scenes really scared me, as did the battle scenes with the invisible creature power. I was also amazed at how real things were in the movie. <br /> <br /> What really gets my attention as an adult is the truth of the film ""forbidden knowledge"" and how relevant that will be when we come into contact (if any) with an advanced (foreign) civilization which is much more developed than we ourselves are. Advanced technology and responsibility seem to go hand in hand. We must do the work for ourselves to acquire the knowledge along with the wisdom of using advanced technology. In my opinion, this is the great morality of the film. <br /> <br /> I learned in the graduate school that ""knowledge is power"" is not correct at best! Knowledge is ""potential"" power, depending on how it is applied (if it is applied at all.) [It's not what you know, but how you use it, what you know!] <Br /> <br /> The Whole The effects of this film could materialize sometime in the future of humanity. The knowledge in and of itself is not enough, we MUST have the wisdom that knowledge really depends on actually controlling our own destiny, OR we'll end up in the movie like the Krell - just extinguished. <br /> <Many thanks to all who responded to previous versions of this article with comments and corrections, they are all very much appreciated !!

On my list of favorite movies (mental list, mind) are the only films with films like The Lord of the Rings Series, Spirited Away and Fly Away Home. <br /> <br /> I can really relate to the main character Jess. At the beginning of the film she is a shy girl with a strange background who has many more friends than boys. She really sucks you in her life. I also can not blame the actor's acting or anyone else in the movie. <br /> <br /> The football was interesting, even for someone like me who has no idea about the rules. The movie never gets boring. The romance is really cute and did not make me blush too much! One thing that really made it was the Indian factor. Jess's parents are Indians and there are many colorful Indian conventions throughout the film that provide a very interesting cultural insight as well as everything else. The Indians are also hilarious! Basically, this is a movie that goes beyond the time to choose the right path and fight for it. <br /> <br /> Comic movies become my favorite movie genre thanks to this movie.

Sure, the acting is miserable, the dialogue is below average and the characters are one-dimensional, but they have huge robots! The special effects themselves are actually pretty good for the period. They are certainly not as polished as today's standards, but they contain a minimum of computer graphics and use miniatures instead, so they have aged fairly well.

I am not one of them. I think he's just an imitator on the Black Metal band (I'm not a fan of Black Metal in general). But when I wore this DVD case to pay for it, I convinced myself that the less authentic something is, the more it tries to convince. So I assumed that I was in a rollercoaster ride with rubber harness and do-it-yourself splashes with a sinister background. Well, that's what I like. <br /> <br /> I came home and put it in. My patience lasted 15 minutes. AWFUL camera work and DISGUSTING quality. And that was then (2002), that it looked as if it had been recorded with a Hi8 camcorder. I left it on the shelf. Maybe a nice evening with beer and bmovies would create a nice backdrop for this ... image. <br /> <br /> After a few months I came back (in the mentioned environment) and saw half. Then not only the aspects mentioned annoyed me. My dislike developed. I noticed how funny Dani (1.65m, 5'5 ""height) looked in his platform shoes and tore a hijacker's head (yes, tear, his head did not seem to have a skull.) I also thought this movie might have No sense, but I have not finished yet, so I was not positive. <br /> <br /> After a few more attempts, I finally managed to finish this streak - a few months ago ... (Yes , it cost me 5.5 years.) So - Dani was indeed funny like Satan / Manson / Super-bad-man HELPER and the movie did NOT make any sense. See, our bad person is busy Dani about bad things too Well, I guess he's just very, very bad indeed they are both and that's it. <br /> <br /> We have a few short stories that are accompanied by Dani's character It's about a guy, the STEAMS SOMEONE'S LEG, because he wants to use it as his own. Exactly, exactly. <br /> <br / > The ROCK BOTTOM of the actor. The CGI is the worst of times. I mean, Stinger beats it (and, boy, Stinger is CGI baaaaad.) History makes no sense. And the quality is ... Let's just say it's not satisfying. The only thing you might be watching is unmotivated violence and blood. Blood and guts are pretty well done. Why, you can actually see that the movie was made there and then went on. (Example - Dani 'The Man' Filth takes a stuffed cat - fake as it may - and then fats her ... and then eats what has fallen out.) Why? We never know, but we know that this cat has been must be on illegal substances, as his heart is almost half the size.) <br /> <br /> You might think, after my comment, that this movie is so bad, it's good, but it's just bad.

The 80s are back with revenge in Witchery, an American-Italian co-production led by the notorious Joe 'D'Amato on the production side and the short-acting director (thank God for little miracles). Directed by Fabrizio Laurenti. As a continuation of Sam Raimi's Evil Dead series in Italy (referred to as ""La Casa""), Witchery delivers some modest Gore food and bad acting. <br /> <br /> A mixture of ghost story, possessions and witchcraft, the movie bounces perplexed from scene to scene, without some serious wood actors and hilarious day-night confusion slowing their progress to the expected end, topped off with a serious WTF -Überraschungs-climax. (I just love the expression on her face ...) Surprisingly, Laurenti succeeds in a few - very few - scenes of a certain tension and malice; Unhappy for him, these few glimpses of mild movie magic go fast and effective. <br /> <br /> The plus sides are experienced when the Gore hits the fan. This section is quite effective and entertaining in the 1980's classic latex and red lacquer style of Italo-Gore, when things were done 100% by hand and could be as shocking and vivid as modest budgets. Only with sadistic joy and few laughter could I observe all the exaggerated ways in which offensive characters (and actors) were gradually mutilated and abused. I just felt sorry for Linda Blair, who apparently could not try any other good, obsessed girl / woman role in his career, the way it looks when reviewing his filmography. <br /> <br /> Well, people - not much to tell, and even less to talk about at home. Do not expect too much if you spend a rainy afternoon with it, and you will probably at least experience some mild fun. It also helps when your rotten little heart beats to the beat of the 80s Euro Gore horror. And if you speak from the heart: Every film in which David Hasselhoff is impaled by a considerable metal object and bleeding heavily through the room and the corridors MUST have it in the right place. <br /> <br /> That's my truth - what? is yours?"

Her two small children then set off to find her only to go missing themselves. Their ordeal is captured on CCTV cameras and before long the family's heart-stopping trauma is not only a complex police investigation but a major national news story.,"""Five Days"" is referred to as something special, a thriller that consists of a series of episodes that are each made on a specific day of a police investigation. But in fact, this element of history turns out to be less significant than might initially be supposed, since the fact that the plot is limited to 24 hours in each episode is barely perceptible, and the program hardly distinguishes from countless others' thrillers. In fact, one can hardly help but make comparisons with the last ""prime suspect"" as one of the cynical female police officers focuses on retirement: and it is not just the absence of Helen Mirren that makes the comparisons unfavorable. There is a lot of serious over-motivation, manipulative music, and a set of characters that seem to be constructed in such a way that everyone is sympathetic in one sense and suspicious in another. And it's possible to guess the guilty party long before the end, not because of the inner dynamics of the story, but because of the construction of the entire drama: certain things must be true to justify the series's focus on specific characters at specific times , Despite these shortcomings, the series grew on me: in the end, I was pretty touched. But it is a sad sign that the BBC, which once made ""The Singing Detective"", boasted of the ""perhaps best drama of the year"": for here there is little genuine originality, and the claim reveals a lack of ambition that is dreadful disappointing. ""Five Days"" is in fact no nonsense; but it is formulaic, and one would hope that the best that the BBC had to offer was something more innovative and fresh."

There was a bit of excitement when we found out that Angie is not really pregnant, and then find out that she is, but that was it. Steve Martin, who is a very talented person and usually brings a lot to a movie, was terrible and his entire character was not so important to this film to make him longer. I really would have liked to see more interactions between the main characters, Kate and Angie, and maybe not for a mere comedy, which unfortunately was not, but maybe a drama with comedic elements. I think if the movie had done that, it could have been a lot of fun, since both actresses are pretty funny in their own way and when I'm sitting here, I can imagine many scenarios that would have been a turmoil."

I ask myself: what do people expect from such films? Are there so many people watching a movie without knowing it? <br /> <br /> ""Creep"" is a HORROR movie and it's a pretty good movie! This automatically means that it has an absurd story of holes, outrageous dangers, and simple one-page characters. So why complain about it? Just take popcorn and coke, make yourself comfortable on your seat and ... then enjoy being scared to death! The first 60 minutes, with almost only Kate and a lonesome tube station, are incredibly frightening. There is tension and anxiety in every corner of the screen, and you'll give some idiots just because a flashing neon lamp suddenly sounds in your back.

Just look at the first hour of ""Creep"" and then leave the cinema or turn off the TV. You know the rest of the story anyway, right? The villain will die and Kate will be the only survivor. But even if you watch this movie to its end, you will not be disappointed. <br /> <br /> ... and if you want to take fear to the next level, do what I did after seeing this movie: leave the movie theater at dark night, go to the next U -Bahn station and take the last train home ..."
8,tt0066817,1,"During WWII in England, Charlie, Carrie, and Paul Rawlins are sent to live with Eglantine Price, an apprentice witch. Charlie blackmails Miss Price that if he is to keep her practices a secret, she must give him something, so she takes a bedknob from her late father's bed and places the ""famous magic traveling spell"" on it, and only Paul can activate it. Their first journey is to a street in London where they meet Emelius Browne, headmaster of Miss Price's witchcraft training correspondence school. Miss Price tells him of a plan to find the magic words for a spell known as Substitutiary Locomotion, which brings inanimate objects to life. This spell will be her work for the war effort.","Bedknobs & Broomsticks is another of Disney's masterpieces. It was filmed with animation sequences and the actors and actresses interact with the animations. (A similar concept was used in Mary Poppins, as the children and Mary disappear in sidewalk art.) I judge this film mainly with children's eyes, because I have not seen him for years. At that time it was one of my favorite movies. It was magical and mystical, and the last scenes (the conflict that started with the ghostly armor that went into battle) were my favorites. There has also been a lot of stop animation using the spells (ie people turning into bunnies), which can be a bit old-fashioned and silly now. (I also think the movie is starting to go slow.) Through a child's eyes, this is a funny movie, and it's easy for kids to get into the places of the kids in the movie. It is a fantastic film that is unfortunately largely forgotten today."

The people of a nearby small town refuse to listen to some teenagers who have witnessed the blob's destructive power. In the meantime, the blob just keeps on getting bigger.","The only thing notable about this movie is that it was Steve McQueen's first big lead. <br /> <br /> McQueen's talent is undeveloped and raw, but refreshingly honest in this scamped little sci-fi horror piece. Steve portrays himself as the anti-establishment, Hot Rod car-loving actor who would become a polished icon of the film industry in just five years. <br /> <br /> Later, McQueen said he hated this movie and ""He was the blob"". But everyone has to start somewhere and The Blob is sweet, fresh and innocent. Would we all have stayed that way? <br /> <br /> The plot is fast-paced and predictable, still a fun hour or so. And it's really fun to see Steve McQueen before he became The King of Kool (and Anita Corsaut before she became Andy Taylor's girlfriend). A close friend sent me the DVD a while ago and it's a nice addition to my Steve McQueen movie collection."

Presented by Al Gore through a lecture that he has given to audiences across the globe, plus through more introspective moments.","A tip, I think, can be collected through the various comments on this topic. <br /> <br /> I was quite surprised at the number of people who liked this movie, who want to do it ""obligatory"" or ""obligatory"". Br /> <br /> I think that gives us some insight in the reason why this movie and the underlying theme so polarized. <br /> <br /> Global warming addresses many people who want to force others to ""get it right"". Above all, it appeals to more 'liberal' leaning people because it has nothing to do with the bedroom's morality, which is usually given to conservatives who want to force you to be 'good'. <br /> <br /> And that's the problem with the movie. Al Gore is a politician. And a very successful one. He just can not help but turn to people who want to force others to act the way they would. The political appeal is just too big. <br /> <br /> And that leaves us with a scientific problem that can be of great importance and is reduced to a political problem attractive to those in politics who have a fondness for forcing others to ""be right close"". <br /> <br /> Another interesting question is how the environmental movement was abducted by such people?"

Is the killer their ancestor, the ""Red Queen"" whom legend says claims seven lives every hundred years?","Emilio Miraglias first Giallo feature, The Night Evelyn came out of the grave, was a great combination of Giallo and Gothic horror - and this second movie is even better! This time we have more of the giallo side of the equation, though Miraglia does not lose the gothic horror styling that made the earlier movie so delightful. This time, Miraglia puts more emphasis on the finer details of the plot, and as a result, it's the typical Giallo maze, with characters everywhere and red herrings dropped every few minutes. This is a definite bonus for the movie as it can be a bit confusing at times. There is always enough to keep the audience interested and Miraglia's storytelling has improved since his earlier film. The plot begins with a scene in which two young girls fight before their grandfather tells them the legend of a rather garish painting in their castle. The legend is about a woman named ""The Red Queen,"" who, legend has it, returns from the grave every hundred years and kills seven people. A few years later, murders begin to appear ... <br /> <br /> Although he made only two giallos, Miraglia has its own tribute. It is obvious that the color red is important to him since it is very pronounced in both films; and he seems to have something against women called 'Evelyn'. He likes locks, gothic atmospheres and stylish murders - that's fine with me! Miraglia may not be Argento when it comes to spilling blood, but he knows how to drop an excessive murder into his movie; and here we have pleasure with a Volkswagen Beetle and a death on an iron fence, which is one of my absolute favorite scenes of Giallo. The female side of the cast is awarded the stunning Barbara Bouchet and Marina Malfatti an attention-grabbing cast of ladies who are not afraid to undress! The score courtesy of Bruno Nicolai is catchy, and although it does not contain much of the psychedelic rock that came in The Night Evelyn's tomb; it goes well with the movie. The end is a bit of a diversion, because although Miraglia refreshes the gothic atmosphere, it seems more than a bit hurry and the identity of the killer is too obvious. But still this is a delightfully entertaining giallo and one that I can warmly recommend to the fans of the genre!"

The means that Ivy reluctantly adopts to resolve the problem of too many men promise disaster for all concerned.","An excellent melodrama of the time murders, in which Fontaine effectively played against her former naive little wallflower type, in a role that Olivia DeHavilland allegedly rejected. That's fine, because Fontaine is wonderful. Spoken by Charles Bennett, who wrote for Hitchcock in the 1930s and later also wrote the award-winning screenplay for the classic British horror movie Night of the Demon. The opening scene, in which Ivy visits a sinister fortune teller played by the wonderful Una O'Connor (the screamer of James Whale's fame), is a tour de force, and the film keeps interest throughout the numerous sinister machinations. I hope to see this movie on DVD someday, but the desperation that this ever happened because it seems like an undeservedly obscure movie.

When Harry Callahan upsets the press and the mayor in his usual style, he's shipped out of town to investigate while the heat is on. With the help of his new Magnum handgun Harry goes on the trail leaving behind the usual trail of dead criminals along the way.","In Don Seal's 1971 masterpiece ""Dirty Harry"", Clint Eastwood embodies the super-hard, super-cool, unorthodox cinema cop with his role of eponymous inspector ""Dirty"" Harry Callahan. Two sequels followed, the first of which, ""Magnum Force"", tamed the politically incorrect posture of the first, which outraged many critics but delighted audiences. The second sequel, ""The Enforcer,"" was grumpier again and was advertised as ""the dirtiest Harry of all"". However, this title belongs to the fourth film in the series, Clint Eastwood's ""Sudden Impact"", which is without a doubt the dirtiest, meanest, most brutal and very dirtiest Harry movies, and in my humble opinion, the second -Best after the masterpiece original. <br /> <br /> *** Attention! SPOILERS ahead! *** In a small town near San Francisco, a mysterious sexy lady (Sondra Locke) lures men to be alone with her. What these men do not know is that their mysterious beauty is their former rape victim and longs for bloody revenge. As luck would have, San Francisco spends härtester policeman Inspector Dirty Harry Callahan, who was suspended because of his anger at his superiors again, his free time in this very small town ... ""Sudden Impact"" is the dirtiest Callahan film in many Respects. The film is extremely crude and graphically violent. Harry Callahan himself is dirtier than ever. Without fear of taking advantage of his 44th Magnum to avoid annoyance, Harry treats ""punks"" as they should be treated and even allows a person with multiple murders to get away, as he believes the revenge killings are justified. As always, Clint Eastwood excels in the role of Harry Callahan. Eastwood embodies Coolness and Bad Assery as the ""Man With No Name"" in Sergio Leone's Dollar Trilogy, and he did so in the Dirty Harry movies. ""Sudden Impact"" gives us the dirtiest Harry we've ever seen. Eastwood's real friend Sondra Locke fits very well into the role of vengeful beauty. The great Pat Hingle, who worked with Eastwood on Ted Post's stubborn western ""Hang 'Em High"" back in 1986, plays the small town police chief. The film also includes a whole series really despicable bastards, including a pathetic criminal who was played by Kevin Major Howard (known for his role in Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"") and a woman named Ray Perkins (Audrie J. Neenan). Undoubtedly one of the most disgusting and despicable female figures in the cinema. Albert Popwell, who robbed the bank robber in the famous ""Do You Feel Lucky?"" Also the scene in ""Dirty Harry"" and the black militant leader in ""The Enforcer"" is back, this time as Harry's colleague and buddy. Overall, ""Sudden Impact"" is the dirtiest and dirtiest of all ""Dirty Harry"" movies (though ""The Dead Pool"" is not exactly tame either), and my second favorite after the brilliant 1971 original. An absolute must for Callahan fans, and highly recommended to all lovers of police timers and cinematic villains. My rating: 8.5 / 10"

Add to that the reality of what it takes to really raise a pot (these plants under the bushes would NOT do it without the TLC they got), and it's a really funny but touching movie.

The movie proved boring, amateurish and ugly-looking ride; The sound recording is so bad that the dialogue is incomprehensible half the time, while the play gives the word incapable a new meaning! Worse, the film follows the awful tired formula of a trio of teenage girls involved in an accident, feeling protected by a dysfunctional family living in remote areas. Soon one of the girls goes for help and is never heard again; another, still bedridden, is quickly disposed of (after being forgotten for most of the time). The heroine is the one who interacts most with the three occupants of the house: a hurricane of a Bible-mumbling mother (a horrendous excess), her oppressed (and suffering) daughter and her strange brother, who occasionally turns up the scene to talk about the sleeping female To drool guests. Often resort to table-table reminiscences by the man-hating mother (as a means to fill the drab, not to mention unoriginal, backstory) and inevitably to mother-daughter sparring Developing competitions, the film has an ace up its sleeve - the twist end is as unexpected as it is ingenious, but it does little to eliminate the bad taste the film has left in the movie through the lameness of it all intermittent gore) or the inescapable feeling of wasting 80 minutes of my time ..."

9,tt0819765,1,A Cambodian assassin finds himself on the run from Hong Kong police after completing his assignment.,"I have to be right away - I have not seen such a solid movie like DOG BITE DOG for a long time. I'm a big fan of CAT III ""old school"" movies from the late '80s to the mid' 90s, and I'd heard that ""style"" of movies with such films comes back a bit Herman Yaus GONG TAU (which I suppose had not yet seen this point ...), so I was very interested in giving some of these newer CAT III films a chance. Did this movie meet my expectations? Absolutely - but not quite as I imagined. <br /> <br /> The story follows a young, animalistic, imaginative and practically unstoppable Thai hitman with a bit of a vague story coming to Hong Kong for a ""mission"". Due to some bad luck, he is quickly identified by a mischievous copy (which emits many of the same qualities as our hit man), and is quickly caught and captured. However, this situation does not last long, as the unnamed assassin escapes his captors and quickly shows the local police that he should not be taken lightly. The hunt continues and a cat-and-mouse game between the police and the ""crazy dog"" (as the police call him) follows. Along the way, Mad Dog is inadvertently made friends with a slowly beating young woman, and a connection between the two forms when she helps him out of a sticky situation. The Ante keeps on rising as Mad Dog's only goal is to come back from Hong Kong and back to Thailand by all means necessary, and the cops continue to try to catch him alive ... <br /> <br /> I could probably write ten paragraphs about this complex and thoroughly layered movie, but I do not want to reveal too much. I've seen DOG BITE DOG, who did not know anything about the premise, and I think that's the kind of movie that's definitely better appreciated that way. As for the comparisons with the older CATIII films, there are some similarities. DOG BITE DOG has some hyper-violent moments reminiscent of the ""good old days"" but is never as greasy or greasy as old-school classics like THE UNTOLD STORY or RED TO KILL. Where many of the older CATIII films were mainly ""shocked"", DOG BITE DOG is a far more elaborate and well-rounded production (though that does not take away from the CATIII films that I love so much.).). This movie is much more ""emotional"" than exploitative. As we learn more about the characters and their backgrounds, audiences begin to connect and identify with each other. There are really no clear ""good"" and ""bad"" types, as Mad Dog shows moments of extreme compassion and the police uses extremely unorthodox methods to try and mold the killer. There is also no nudity / sex in this film, which is a typical feature of older CATIII films. Personally, I would compare DOG BITE DOG more with Parks SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE or perhaps the BANGKOK DANGEROUS of the Pang Brother, as both films mixed extreme emotional undertones with strong and unrelenting action and violence. Once again - there's pretty much nothing I did not like about this movie. The drama is dead, the camera is sharp and well done, and the whole film skillfully blends several elements together, as it's not often seen. Is this movie (and others like it ...) the ""rebirth"" of the CATIII movie - not exactly - but it's a very solid movie that's definitely worth a visit ... 9/10"

She was excited because the box said it was funny. Fortunately, the propaganda on the boxes never. <br /> <br /> This movie was an exercise in patience. This is one of those films in which, unless you are a sophisticated and superficial person who likes to watch movies about yourself, you will hate every character in the movie. Until the introduction of a nice character. Which of the nerve-wracking characters will fall in love and act in such a way that in the real world he will drive anyone away. <br /> <br /> MILD SPOILERS FROM HERE <br /> <br /> So a bunch of emotionally unstable, haughty, flashy artists swear the love and find success in their careers. Then they meet a nice, intelligent, emotionally mature and loving character (almost perfect type). Then we see how the woman, the annoyed arrogant artist (in her 30s?)

She is rude to the man and does everything in her power to drive him out. In the real world, she would have been pretty successful. I definitely wanted to escape from her and I was not even in a relationship with her! <br /> <br /> Although it's nice that the man ""fought for his love,"" I never wanted her to have him. (Not my girlfriend either) She did not deserve it. And why I wonder if the director thinks that the ""almost perfect guy"" should be punished by having to relate to her? When the artist asked the ""almost perfect guy"" to leave, we screamed that he should leave as well. There is a problem with a movie when the heroine of the movie is so annoying, childish and stupid that you want her to fail. <br /> <br /> In addition, let me say that Andy Dick has even made me laugh a couple of times, even though his character was also pretentious to annoyance. In terms of the other characters, they were well-played, morally bankrupt and annoying characters. <br /> <br /> It's a comedy and I can say that I laughed a few times in the movie. Unfortunately, not much has been laughed up to the last 10 minutes. But by the time I had those laughs, I had prayed that the movie ended far too long. I had to get those lazy characters out of my life. <br /> <br /> If you want to see people you hate fighting with a love for people they do not deserve, then that's the movie for you."

The exact content of the film I can not clearly describe: This colonialism is an important part, as well as the inability to cope with such a past, but also the personal memories of the main character are a central theme and his pursuit of social responsibility contact and love. These are the symbolic themes that I have derived from the movie, but in fact they are nothing more than impressions. <br /> <br /> But even if you're just trying to follow the linear story without these symbolic backgrounds, you'll still discover an extremely intriguing movie full of gorgeous imagery (beautiful close-ups of Beatles, larvae and other nasty insects alternate off with great dream sequences and also the dark atmosphere gives the film a special style).

This is the same place where kids like ""Pokémon"", ""Pepper Ann"", ""Mighty Morphin Power Rangers"" and ""VR Troopers"" (please note that three of the above titles are crass Japanese exports, courtesy of Fox Network and Saban Entertainment). Do not worry, you are just sampling some of the high quality dishes that were available to the children in the late 80's and early 90's. Some examples of this period would be ""Transformers"", ""Garfield and Friends"", ""Captain Power"" and ""C.O.P.S."" (a cartoon NOT to be confused with the live action show on Fox). In addition to these prime examples, Disney also returned to syndicated programs for children who had a lineup called ""The Disney Afternoon."" Aside from a rundown show called ""The Gummy Bear"", early shows like ""Darkwing Duck"", ""Duck Tales"" and ""Chip 'N Dale's Rescue Rangers"" gave credit to the Disney Animation teams, who also played theater classics like ""The Little Mermaid"", "" The Beauty and the Beast, The Savior Down Under and The Great Mouse Detective. But above all these miracles shine ""TaleSpin"". The premiere of ""Plunder and Lightning"" was a two-hour thrill ride and won an Emmy. To my great joy, the rest of the episodes were appropriate to the promise of the premiere. <br /> <br /> While I enjoy the plot and the dialogue, the main attraction for me is the characters. There's Rebecca Cunningham, an independent woman, but still fallible; Kit Cloudkicker, full of teenage fear and optimism; Louie, with his loyalty and support; Frank Wildcat, the most entertaining engineer since Scotty on the original ""Star Trek""; Cute and witty, but with some depth that most children do not have, and of course in the middle of everything, Molly Cunningham has Baloo, which I would describe as a sloppy version of James Bond. Because if there's trouble, Baloo rescues the day with the help of his sleeker and fastest Sea Duck (Read: James Bond's Aston Martin). Of course, every great show has to have big villains, and TaleSpin does not disappoint. From the megalomaniac of the businessman Shere Kahn over the vain and ever-failing air pirate Don Karnage to the hilarious and awkward Soviet-satirized Thembrians.

However, I've seen this movie three times already ... and believe me, it's a great movie. <br /> <br /> VIVAH goes back to the traditional route, showing simple characters in a sensible and realistic story of travel between engagement and marriage. The film entertains in all ways how it can be reflected on what we do (or would do) when it comes to marriage. In this sense, Sooraj R. Barjatya has done well his homework and incorporated a very realistic story into a well done entertaining movie. <br /> <br /> Several sequences in this movie interest you immediately: <br /> <br /> * When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the bride (Amrita Rao) - as he tries to look at her without to make it clear to him and her family. The song ""Do Anjaane Ajnabi"" fits well with the mood of this scene. <br /> <br /> * The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita when he comes to visit them - eg a shy Shahid who does not know exactly what to talk about but draw from a decent conversation. Also, Amrita's naive nature, limited eye contact, shy features, and the answer to Shahid's questions. <br /> <br /> * The emotional collapse of Amrita and her uncle (Alok Nath) as she feeds him at Shahid's party into the daughter-in-law of another instead of her uncle's beloved niece. <br /> <br /> The film clearly belongs to Amrita Rao all the way. The actress portrays the role of Poonam with the conviction that one can not imagine anyone replacing her. She looks beautiful throughout the movie and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectly. <br /> <br /> Shahid Kapoor is also brilliant. He delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to playing in a Sooraj R. Barjatya movie. In fact, Shahid and Amrita undoubtedly make a sweet couple on the screen. Other characters - Alok Nath (excellent), Anupam Kher (brilliant), Mohan Joshi (very good). <br /> <br /> On the whole, VIVAH, as promised, keeps a well-made and realistic story of two families. The film has first-class performances, an excellent story and great music suitable for the film, and is directed by the fabulous Sooraj R. Barjatya. You must have seen something like that!"

This movie is completely shot in English, is full of Anglo actors and has production values ​​that are so awful that it's ridiculously bad .... but not funny! Who can we blame for this garbage? Acting, dialogue and most sets were pretty bad. Some of the fight scenes looked like they had been choreographed by the local High School Drama Club. The special effects were also mostly bad, but some were just cheap animations that were patched on the screen, giving a particularly cheesy effect. There's a big outdoor epic fight scene where a few thousand extras in a costume are running across a field, but when we see the two armies clashing in combat - HA! What a joke! The movie shows some beauties. What a pity that they did not show a bit more skin. At least that would have been worth something for the boys. Do not worry."

Just as winter approached and everything is on lock down for 8 months with no flights available in and out of the Amundsen-Scott station, Dr Nielsen had to find a way to treat herself whilst enduring harsh weather conditions and limited medical resources.","I have always admired Susan Sarandon for her integrity and honesty in her private life as well as her talents as an actor. So I found it odd that she appeared in a movie that distorted those facts so much. The salvation of her character from the South Pole was carried out by a Canadian charter company from Edmonton, Alberta, flying a Canadian designed and built Twin Otter aircraft. The trip was rejected by the US Air Force, the Navy, and the Coast Guard as beyond their capabilities. A few years later, the same company made a similar rescue to bring a man out of the South Pole base. I think the movie is a very gripping theme, documenting a very brave woman from a daunting task. I do not understand why the producers would find it necessary to ignore the bravery of the rescue pilots and show the rescue plane as Hercules of the USAF."

Of course I found the whole movie hilarious, especially the mannerisms of the characters. It was not until I was much older and looked at it again that I realized how much deeper this show actually is. <br /> <br /> Michael Keaton and Gedde Watanabe shine in their role as reluctant mediators. Keaton stops surprising me with his true style of delivery, and Watanabe adds humor and pathos to the mix. I also found that Patti Yasutake (Umeki) was just fabulous in her role as a comic book relief. <br /> <br /> I think this movie is one of the most underrated movies of the 80s. We can all learn a lesson from the fusion of American and Japanese workers in this film ... sometimes you can really have ""the best of both worlds"". And now I understand why my mother felt like she did in those last moments. I would rather have one of these cars as well."

However, these monsters are allergic to cat scratching ... I've never been a fan of sleazy, overrated bestsellers like King, Koontz or Barker, but this B-movie, written by Mr. Dung himself, is not nearly as bad as he could be His. Yes, it can be terribly awful at times, but there are actually some surprisingly impressive details: a good old-fashioned graveyard, a sinister soundtrack, and a candlelit gothic-house scene, a mirror showing the monstrous form of the villains. Naturally. The film is polluted by Mr. Dung's foolish talk and the toilet-seat obsession with denigrating fat people, resulting in a pointless subplot of rapist teachers, but there are roses under dung."

For Stanley, it's the struggle to read and realize its potential. For Iris it is the courage to love again after becoming a widow. The beauty of the film is the dance that Robert DeNiro and Jane Fonda do together, start and stop before everyone has the skills and the courage to trust each other and move on. In this sense, it gives us a very good overview of how life is often, and is therefore credible. Unlike other reviewers, I found the characters that were rendered consistent throughout the image. The supporting actors are also carefully selected and add a character depth, which is added to the main characters by the supporting performances. All in all, an excellent movie. The best I can make of it is hope."

Before I saw this ""Emma"", I had seen two earlier versions, but in one, Emma seemed completely wrong, more like Lady Teazle, and in the other, she seemed half wrong, like a possible cheater, while she was here just seemed right, young and silly and stubborn. In general, I thought that the attitude and the atmosphere of the production conveyed the charm of the novel extraordinarily well; in fact, it's one of the cutest, funniest things I've ever seen, more like a Christmas treat. The script is unusually well formed, and the additions to the adapter, such as the lightwell that reveals Harriet to Emma in the church, are all fine. Mark Strong as Knightley is not what I expected, but I enjoyed it very much: he emphasizes the factual, practical side of the character, as opposed to Emma's affects, and his choleric outbursts against Frank Churchill are quite funny. Bernard Hepton makes Mr. Woodhouse a figure of almost Carroll's absurdity; Samantha Morton as Emma's protégé is as soft and as tight as she should be. And as in the ""Pride and Prejudice"" of producers is taken to ensure that the possible coupling of characters - in some cases clearly - can be believed. This production was and remains a pleasure for me."

And his directorial work is as comatose as it can possibly be without him actually sleeping during the process. <br /> <br /> But the worst thing is Woody Harrelson, whom I usually like when he is properly staffed. He plays ""The Walker"", a gay man in D.C., who plays the bored wives of the Washington elite a social companion. He could not have been one-dimensional if he had been cut from a magazine and whirled around with an ice-stick in front of the camera. His ""southern accent"" is that off-the-shelf version that decodes from the beginning to the end of every line he delivers, as if the heat and humidity of the south still drains him of every single energy he has , It is monotonous. But that's not the worst accent in the movie. His ""friend"", played by Moritz Bleibtreau, tries to influence a kind of Mid-East accent that is so awkward it can barely deliver the bad lines written for it. He is unable to roll his r, although in real life he is German and speaks several languages ​​- one of which is Italian! That's a good reason to occupy someone, do not you think? <br /> <br /> From storytelling to screenplay, directing, cinematography and leads, this film is bad from start to finish. The only bearable moments in the film came from three supporting actresses: Lily Tomlin, Lauren Bacall and Kristin Scott Thomas. Only these three managed with dignity in tact through the film. In fact, all three are excellent, even though they are trapped in a really bad movie. Unfortunately, nobody could ever be good enough to solve these endless mistakes. If you like these three actresses, look at them in something else. This movie is not worth your time."

The Grinch is a nasty creature that hates Christmas, and plots to steal it away from the Whos which he equally abhors. Yet a small child, Cindy Lou Who, decides to try befriend the Grinch.","Ron Howard has directed? The 1966 cartoon is charming and teaches a simple lesson for children with a simple plot. In this movie, Howard gives us a Whoville filled with greedy, manipulative, egocentric whos. Jim Carrey is terrible, but I'm sure it's not his fault; I imagine the script calls for the most vicious person imaginable, so Carrey channeled Tom Green and the result is movie magic. Similar to Danny Devito's ""Penguin in Batman Returns,"" Carrey's Grinch is so unlike any kind of comedy one could derive from his character that simply evaporates. While the 1966 cartoon showed a Grinch we could all identify with, Carreys Grinch is the evil, soulless old man we've all seen at some point, mumbling to himself in a parked car or toddlers stumbling his cane in the supermarket. This Grinch has no humanity, sense of humor or insight, and his salvation at the end of the film sounds wrong. The whole movie sounds wrong: There's a stupid Christmas lights contest, a failed attempt to explain why the Grinch is such an idiot by digging into his childhood, and an undecipherable secret as to why some of the Whos do not have that weird lip extension of them , In contrast to the 1966 cartoon, I would imagine that children would find this film tiresome, irritating and full of conflicting messages. Did we really have to see Slutty Smurf, aka Christine Baranski as Martha May Whovier? In addition, Ron Howard filled the cast with his untalented relatives. Throw the required butt jokes, fart jokes, sex jokes and other compulsory Carreyesque low-brow humor, and you have a movie that is so far from the 1966 cartoon (or book that inspired it), such as George W.

It is the true story of Marines privateer Al Schmid, who at the expense of his own sight during a wounded fought off a horde of storming Japanese on Guadalcanal. <br /> <br /> The story is divided into three parts, Al Schmid's home, where he is a simple worker who is getting serious with a woman and does not like anything better than his bowling night. Pearl Harbor gets bombed and he goes to war like millions of others. <br /> <br /> The second part is in Guadalcanal and we see part of the action where he is in an isolated machine gun nest and holding Japanese troops. His action prevented naval positions from being overrun, but a grenade makes in his eyesight. <br /> <br /> And of course the third part is his painful adaptation to civilian life and to reassure oneself that people are not just taking care of him out of pity, especially this girl he saw Eleanor Parker. <br /> <br /> This film was aired on TCM on John Garfield's 95th birthday and there was a documentary about Garfield hosted by his daughter. One of the interviewees said that Garfield was the most believable in working class roles when he had and held a union card. <br /> <br /> In this regard, he was lucky that he landed at Warner Brothers in Hollywood. Although he was repeatedly typed into gangster roles in the tradition of this studio, Garfield was terrific in these parts because of his background, for he came from the kind of life Al Schmid had, with the exception of Garfield's Jewish background. <br /> <br /> In this regard, he was perfect to play the role of a working-class hero like Al Schmid, who took responsibility for defending his country. No Super Heroics here, just a guy who would have preferred to be in Philadelphia but had done a job that needed to be done. <br /> <br /> It's a big part for Garfield.

Unfortunately, it was not a good movie. There are several scenes that are far too long and really pointless like the dance scene. A few scenes are just a pretext to focus the camera on female body parts. Acting is bad, but some of the lines are amusing in their abominations. What's really strange is that it turns into a 5-minute Western at the end of the movie, and in the end, the spins they were made of make no sense to the rest of the movie. It seemed like the director had just added something because he thought it would look cool while the plot of the movie was ignored up to that point. It just did not make much sense.

If I can stop someone from looking at him, I've done a good thing. <br /> <br /> This ""new"" version is full of talent and everything goes awry. Kenneth Branagh OK, an ugly, sterile, a music notation. He films the film from any artistic, distracting, self-centered perspective. We see reflections of the actors in stainless steel, on security monitors, shots from 200 feet high, close-up of eyes, chin and so on. The script, by a Nobel laureate, introduces long stretches of unpleasant homosexual banter, which are faked by both parties, .... I think ?? Given the character ""Twists"", how would I know? The characters themselves, so richly drawn in the original, are crass and unsympathetic. The runtime was shortened by one hour, which is either the real problem or the friendliest thing the director has done for us. The actors effectively execute their lines, but nothing they say or do is remotely believable. Jude Law is more than Caine, but as a producer he got Branagh's blessing. <br /> <br /> All in all, I thought it was ugly to see it, not the shell of a former classic. Why was it done ???

After the establishment of the Islamic Republic in Iran, women are not allowed to enter the stadiums.","I got the impression that this movie is as much about human sexuality as it is about anything else, intentional or not. We are also shown how absurd and paradoxical that women are not allowed to experience such a nationally important event, forgetting the past of our respective ""advanced"" nations. I write from Japan, where women only had the right to vote 60 years ago and technical technicians are a new phenomenon. Pubs in England used to be just men, the business world was until recently completely taboo for women in America, and women in China had their feet tied so that they could not develop feet strong enough to escape their husbands. Iran is going through this period in our time, and we get a good overview of how ridiculous we all have ever been. Back to the subject of sexuality, we must wonder what it really is about women who make them unfit for football (the official reason is that the men are bad). Especially such boyish girls, a couple so much that one even has the feeling that also lesbian topics are on the agenda. I think one point is that not all women are the same, and the women the police are trying to ""protect"" are not those who would try to get inside. The opening scenes of the approach to the stadium make you appreciate the bravery of the young women who try - and each one for themselves - to even enter. It is a brutal male world. Any woman brave enough to go try should be allowed! The world of sexuality is not one size. <br /> <br /> Meanwhile, the arrested criminal girls gather in the makeshift pen and wait for their deportation to who-knows-where, and in a much more subtle way, start connecting with the guards who watch over her. These had clear ideas of women and femininity, which were challenged head-on. The change of attitude is glacial, but visible. <br /> <br /> Since the film is pure Iran from the first moment, the stranger needs a little relief, but the characters have a special way of loving themselves to you, and you get the whole picture and even understand the misunderstandings of the men and give them carelessness. The alleged villain is the invisible patriarchy of the ayatollahs, which remains unseen and unnamed and is unlikely to be recognized. <br /> <br /> I know that this movie was filmed during the Iran-Bahrain incident, which was awe-inspiring for everyone involved."

The complexity of the characters and the way the dialogue unfolds them is a delight to the intelligent moviegoer, but the film is accessible enough to make it a popular mainstream hit, and rightly so. Chess is merely the photogenic backdrop for the development of an emotional and emotional film, though the game is treated with enough respect to almost convince a chess player that the characters existed.

Can anyone tell me where the humor in Prizzi's Honor is?

For example, when Jagger and an unidentified Cambodian wade through the water, it is obvious that they are really just going in place and the background is projected badly behind them. And when they have left the water, their costumes are 100% dry !!! There is horrible continuity and brainless dialogues throughout the movie - so much so that it is hard to imagine why they did not ask Bela Lugosi or George Zucco to star in the movie - both starring in many class Z horror movies. In many ways, this would be a perfect example of a film class about NOT doing a movie. <br /> <br /> So while it's a 3, it's probably a bit too generous, it's fun to laugh about and short, so it's worth a look for bad movie fans."
9,tt0088176,1,A Midwestern farm family faces major emotional adjustment after a tragedy results in the death of an older brother.,"I had seen this movie back in the 80's and had almost forgotten it when I realized it was back on TV and looked at it. I remembered liking this little sleeper when I saw it first, and I liked it better the second time I looked at it. <br /> <br /> All the actors, including Robert Duvall, Glenn Close, Wilfred Brimley, Frederic Forrest, and Jason Presson (as the twelve-year-old boy responsible for the accidental death of his older brother) are great. The film has a very authentic feel - a subliminal, calm, deeply moving story of a family suffering from grief. Dialogue is sparse, but narrative, and nonverbal action is excellent. Similar to a simpler, rural version of Ordinary People without a psychiatrist, but equally impressive family dynamics. <br /> <br /> The Stone Boy is worth the time and emotional energy that comes with watching."

When her father objects, she rebels. Harlan, meanwhile, thinks she's his soul mate, and he starts making plans to get her away from her father. Worlds are set to collide, but which ones?","This movie really did make a good start. It had the potential to turn into a truly heartbreaking, romantic love story with cinematography that captured the love between ""Harlan"" and Tobe in long, poetic and idyllic scenes. It really did not have to be anymore and for a moment there I was excited that someone was finally making a nice movie for its own sake, another timeless classic, maybe a modern myth. Why, oh why, then screw it up halfway, turning the main character (Norton) into another psycho? Maybe I'll reveal the point, but do we really need another movie about psychos? Or is it necessary in Hollywood to portray the sick side of human nature, which indicates a general malaise in the film industry? For a moment I would write down the name of the director; Now I feel indifferent. At the very least, in the film's defense, it should be added that all actors seemed to be investing in their roles. Also Evan Rachel Wood is really nice to look at and a good actress with a lot of potential."

It was okay to see the guy in the cape and the hunchback.

Some of the speakers were no longer available. After 15 or 16 episodes, Frank Welker (who played Fred) became unavailable. I think Velma's voice changes after the first 12 episodes because the first voice actress Velma played was not available. <br /> <br /> And the network ordered the studio Hanna Barbera, with Shaggy, Scooby doo and Scrappy Doo, because the ratings were high. So they had to do more shorts. I wish they were mysteries like 15 episodes. Still, it's a good show."

No family behaves like that. It's as if they were transported by Pleasantville or Leave it to Beaver. You are a caricature of what we think a family is when we are 7.

I did not expect the plot to follow the book exactly, but they have omitted too many key components of the book. The film attempted, but failed, to deliver a powerful and inspiring message, humiliating only the central theme of the prophecy.

Bette also pampers us with ""Rose's Turn"" by GYPSY and the theme tune from her smash movie THE ROSE as well as a shameless plug for her hit movie THE FIRST WIVES CLUB. She brings the house towards the end with ""Stay With Me, Baby"" by THE ROSE and her only number 1 hit album ""Wind Beneath My Wings"" by BEACHES.

It was not well thought out and sometimes seemed very choppy and incoherent. <br /> <br /> In the first streak, the MIB organization had a sort of ""elite"" sense of power. You had some special agents and it had a ""secret"" feeling. In the sequel, the MIB organization has a JROTC Summer Camp atmosphere. <br /> <br /> The movie was not terrible or anything .. it just lacked the ""coolness"" (for lack of a better set) of the first movie. A lot of the same old humor was recycled from first to second, adding no real originality to the MIB universe. <br /> <br /> A perfect analogy would be Episode 1 of the first 3 films. Was it decent? Yes. Is it worthy to wear his title? Not really."

It tries to be a sci-fi / drama / thriller, but fails with each of the three. <br /> <br /> As a Frankenstein remake, it misses everything that made the original good. Nobody calls the doctor insane or even threatens to throw him out of the hospital. The transformation scene consists of a coma victim opening an eye and the amazing computer that makes it possible is not even shown. When the experiment works, there is no praise, and when it starts to go wrong, there is little reaction. <br /> <br /> Any suspense about who the killer might be is shattered by showing him in the same room with all the possible suspects.

The little blonde child meets his cues pretty well. <br /> <br /> I also gave an extra star for the scene where the husband drives south from the bridge, it cuts to a U-turn on an unrelated parking lot and then he is immediately back on the bridge goes north.

This film is about a youth in the early to mid-60s in Sweden and about the problems that * read * contradictions * faced by the nation and the world. Occasionally, Yellow seems to be a serious socio-political documentary, with Lena, the protagonist, and others who interview both ordinary people and politicians (such as Olaf Palme at home). At other times, Yellow seems to be parodying this kind of documentation. All the while, Yellow is a personal documentary exploring Lena's life - her domestic life, her love, her political views, her view of herself. She is a complete person ?? complex, flawed, contradictory, happy, sad, curious. And above all that lies the wonderful additional dimension of the director Sjöman and his crew, who document themselves and document Lena. That's what gives me yellow wings. Not only do they suddenly appear in very funny times and in a funny way, they remind the viewer that this is fiction and artificiality, but their presence is itself another layer of the film; You are filming yourself. I am reminded of a Björk music video with the same quality? a music video about making a music video, ad infinitum, with each repetition becoming stranger and more cartoonish. I think Sjöman may have had something similar in mind. While ""Jag är Nyfiken? Yellow"" may not be for everyone, it's certainly intelligent, funny, refreshing, exuberant and authentic."

Although based on the original Paramount script, there is more than a half-hour break, and the director's indifference forgoes what's left. With few exceptions, the younger generation was not interested in watching old black-and-white films on television in 1973 (still true, unfortunately), so that this bright, compelling story was new to the overwhelming majority of viewers; Then as now, ratings and redemption were the only reel-raison d'etre.

The drama was not good and the plot was not even interesting. <br /> <br /> 'Cabin on the lake' is a good TV movie. The sequel was not. Judd Nelson was very good in the first movie and added a lot more character to his character. It seemed he was not interested in doing the sequel. His acting was good, but it could have been better. I do not want to comment on the rest of the cast, because in my opinion they are not even worth mentioning. But I will do it. The character of Alison is not even shown in the first part of the movie. Suddenly, she is the focus of attention alongside Stanley Caldwell. The role made no sense and it should have been better thought out. Dahlia Salem was absolutely terrible. Her acting was far below average, and casting people should have been looking for someone else. The director, Mike, was a confusing character. He seemed intent on being there, but it did not seem that his death was necessary. The play for this role was good, nothing great, but better than Salem's. <br /> <br /> The plot was really bad, if you think about it. Stanley, who is probably dead, is on his way to ""Cabin by the Lake,"" the film based on his screenplay. He stumbles over the director and in a short time the director is dead and Stanley directs the show. Yes, out of nowhere the crew will just let that stranger in and finish the movie without knowing anything about him. There are a few killings, not a lot, and those shown are ridiculous. One of the actresses on set is electrocuted while filming a scene. Another character is chewed by a motorboat. And you get entangled in drowning in a plant. These authors must have been happy with excitement. <br /> <br /> I just have to say that I was not impressed by the shooting of the film. The way the company changed from a low budget back to a normal state quickly became irritating. The new hut on the lake was badly laid out. We're only showing it in a few scenes, and the whole thing with the chain in the basement was useless. It only worked in the first movie because we were shown the room a lot more, but it did not work in this one. <br /> <br /> There were too many characters in this sequel. All but a few had no reason to be there. The spectacle of what little is shown was really bad and ... they just had no purpose in this movie. <br /> <br /> All in all, ""Return to Shack at the Lake"" is a continuation of the collecting upstairs from where the first one has stopped. I can take ""hut by the lake"", but that was just not impressive. Judd Nelson should have avoided that, and so should you. It's nothing like the first one and it was all too slow. Nothing happened in the first hour and it continued for the second. Not to mention that the writing was awful. Use this only if you need help to sleep. <br /> <br /> Well, we see that Stanley defies death and is still alive and well. By the way, it sounds like a third episode of a movie alone would be good.

It celebrates the development of the understanding of ordinary people in ordinary families and the innate ability of young people to teach the old."

Daniel Auteil, from the distasteful ""The Closet"" of 2001, plays down his role and is afraid of playing too much (rightly, the role could have been ruined if the actor were too dramatic). However, I felt that the part was a bit more realistic and focused more on the character itself than on the character's growth. <br /> <br /> Do not go into this movie and expect the dark humor and the unexpected twists You have ""Toto the hero"" because you will be disappointed.

Two, old people and people whose idea of ​​comedy is unbelievably predictable, poorly written, stale jokes. <br /> <br /> CBC really needs to take a look at what they do and who their audience is. If you write comedy only for really old people, guess what's going to happen, their audience is going to die soon and they will not have an audience anymore. I wonder, who ever writes for this show? Do you think that they are actually Muslim or hip, funny young people? No, I'll bet they are old white guys who wrote the same jokes for the same kind of bad CBC shows since the 1960s. <br /> <br /> If you look at CBC's comedy shows, Air Farce is finally taken out of the air (thank goodness!), but we still have lame ducks like this hour has 22 minutes and Rick Mercer, for whom we pay, not to mention this poor excuse for the ""comedy"" Little Mosque on the Prairie.

He is thrown into a vortex where time, dreams, and reality collide in an increasingly whirling slipstream. It's a surreal and dreamlike tale of one man's journey.","What Hopkins manages with this effort, as a writer and director, makes us feel that we know absolutely no one in the film. Maybe that's the problem. His film has a lot of ambition and his intentions were obviously complex and drawn from very deep inside, but it's so impersonal. There are no characters. We never know who someone is, so there is no investment from us. <br /> <br /> It could be a scriptwriter who mixes with his own characters. Is it? Could be. By that I do not mean that Slipstream is ambiguous; I mean that there is nothing to say. Hopkins' film is an experiment. At first glance, one could argue that it is a would-be scriptwriter who realizes, at the moment of his meeting with fate, that life is a stroke of luck and / or success is a blind coincidence, as he becomes in a ""slipstream ""hurled by collisions between times, dreams, thoughts and reality. Nonetheless, it is so tirelessly cerebral that it leaves no room for any hint of emotion, even for the tiny, rather rudimentary extent that allows us to connect with its characters. <br /> <br /> I did not think the Nippy and Extravagant school of shaky, machine-gun speed camera work and editing broke me, but thinking about the movie I start to realize that it had a lot to do with it. There are so many films of the last decade in which the cuts or camera movements have sound effects, as well as other atmospheric technical Doodads. I suppose that in this case it was justified that his purpose was to compose the impressionistic responsiveness of dreams. However, I hardly knew anything about Slipstream when I saw it, and I came out in the same way. And I do not care, because Hopkins does not bother us to take care of it. There are interactive films and there are films that sit and knit in a rocking chair without being aware of their presence. Slipstream is the latter."

Interviews with mostly British actors are also included, attempting to explain why American actors have more problems performing Shakespearean plays than they do.","Shakespeare seems to have a high forehead, which in turn corresponds to a group of people who do not see what it really is. At some point in this movie, someone (Pacino's producer, I think) warns him that the movie is out of control, that it was all about how the masses think about Shakespeare through the vehicle of RICHARD III. Instead, he decides to spin a choppy game with random comments. Some scenes seemed to be included as home movies for Al (was there any reason for a quick visit to Shakespeare's birthplace except for a laugh about something unexpected happening in there?), And before the movie really starts, we'll be treated to watch Al prance around and act nice and funny for the camera. I thought his silly plot with Kay towards the end of Godfather III with the knife at his throat was an act - but apparently it's the way Al really behaves personally. <br /> <br /> Enough long-winded. Here's a shotgun, why I did not even make it: 1) pretentious - Al always knows when the camera is on top of him, whether he is acting as Richard or in a 'real' conversation with someone - you can see it in the corner of your eye Even some of the actors who stand around the sample table become unkempt and hammer to the utmost. If someone who reads this has ever spent time with a group of actors and is witnessing these things from the outside, it is unbearable. ""Look at me and chew the whole landscape!"" 2) Winona Ryder. When she appears as Lady Anne, this movie comes to a screeching stalemate from which he never recovers. She has nothing to add in the discussion scenes, but the camera stays with her to bring in the kiddoes. Their performance is terrible to boot. 3) The only things you really learn from it are told to you by the scholars who try to keep the filmmakers out of the picture. Of course you also learn that Pacino should not direct (or Richard in the first place). I'd rather see BOBBY DEERFIELD than that. <br /> <br /> Finally, read the play and learn it yourself. Get out there and look at it. In 1997, I saw the play performed at the Ethnic Cultural Theater of the University of Washington, and it did what we see in this movie as a high school drama (apart from the groundless throat of Clarence, my God, was that necessary ?! ) It's all just a bunch of sound and rage, which means Nada."

As always, the good business people have mixed feelings - they want to get rid of the bad guys but like the business they bring. It still applies: Relaxed alcohol and gambling law and industry promotion, but pretend to complain about the shabby effects it can have on ordinary people. What's fascinating about this film is Mitchu's cynical-intensive portrayal of the city's cleansing of the wicked and the city's acceptance that its violent methods were the only ones.

The shooting of the main salon bordered on evil, but it was an effective way to combat the spread of poison. <br /> <br /> Overall, a very good movie with its only guilt, which tends to be a little hokhness - not so good for do-gooders who would probably bargain with evil for a lifetime instead of getting it break up."

It seems they actually made a much longer movie and then cut it down for the standard movie show. For how much longer? To fill all the holes in the storyline as we have them would take another three hours of narration and character development - especially given the fact that the movie we have is just so slow and takes itself so seriously. <br /> <br /> That's breathtaking; What could the Halperins have been trying to do here? Her previous film ""White Zombie"" was a successful low-budget attempt to copy the early monster movies of Universal Studios (The Mummy, Dracula, etc.) and, as such, be pretty close to the zombie mythology that would be familiar to those in North America popular magazines. <br /> <br /> Revolt of the zombies, on the contrary, is supposed to have been intended as an allegory for the politics of modern war. Not only would this explain the opening and change of Dean Jagger's character to megalomania, but it would also explain why the zombies do not do much in the movie except to stand around looking frightening and waiting for orders - they're just allegorical soldiers not the undead cannibals we all love and loathe in zombie movies. I've coped with all my aversion to the modern war and its politics - but I think a movie should be entertaining at first, and educational later. And definitely - a movie about zombies should be about zombies. Really one of the most bizarre movies in Hollywood history, but not one that I can recommend, even for historical value."

The antidote's toxicity excites Prof. Rukh into paranoid rages as he seeks revenge against the members of his expedition, who he accuses of stealing his discovery for their own glory.","Prof. Janos Rukh (Boris Karloff) discovers Radium X - a powerful force for nuclear power. Unfortunately, Rukh has been contaminated by radium and begins to glow in the dark - and his touch causes instant death. Dr. Felix Benet (Bela Lugosi) is developing an antidote - but Rukh is starting to go crazy with radium and the antidote, and sets about killing everything he thought was wrong. <br /> <br /> The plot is silly and The ""effects"" that make Karloff shine in the dark are ridiculous, but that's still a funny little cooler. It moves fast, has a great atmosphere (note Rukh's ""house"" and the movie starts on a dark and rainy night) and Karloff and Lugosi (as always) give great performances. There are also good plays by Franic Drake (as Rukh's wife) and Violet Kemble Cooper (as his mother). So it's fine, but only one step below the other Karloff / Lugosi movies. The plot is just too farfetched for me to swallow. Nevertheless, I liked that. I give it a 7."

It is sometimes very touching and very well done in every way.

I've really enjoyed seeing Reese Witherspoon at such a young age and doing a pretty good job. Jason London is also doing a good job. And the only other person I recognized was Sam Waterston, who did a fantastic job with his role. I really liked Sam's character (Matthew Tran). Sometimes he seems to be the kind of father you fear, but in the end you really like his character. The rest of the cast was also very good. <br /> <br /> If you started watching movies about growing up and dealing with what life throws at you, then you should watch this movie. I'd suggest reading the storyline, and if that sounds like something you're interested in, then go for it. Hopefully you enjoy the movie, thanks for reading, <br /> <br /> Chris"

Through the sharp words of Mr. Knightley, and the example of the opinionated Mrs. Elton, someone not unlike herself, Emma's attitudes begin to soften...","This is indeed a god adaptation of Jane Austen's novel. Compared to the American version with Guinneth Paltrow, the script was written to be as close as possible to the book. But the acting was terrible. Besides Kate Beckinsale, whom I believe is a true reflection of Emma in the book, all the other actors have gone to great lengths. Mark Strong was not the ""gentleman"" he should be. He was often rude and insulting, had no feeling at all, and throughout the movie you could not see his love for Emma ""growing"" at all. This had a terrible effect on Kate Beckinsale, who apparently tried to ""oust"" her lead role and her partner. There was also no chemistry between the entire cast. Harriet Smith, played by Samantha Morton, seemed to have no real attachment to Mr. Elton, played by Dominic Rowan. Therefore, she did not seem so heartbroken as she was portrayed in the book. The settings of the film are too bad. The costumes are even more. I would have imagined Emma Woodhouse dressing herself here more fashionably and elegantly. The end is too long. It's good that it's like the end of the book, but it's a killer ending to a movie. And again, in the face of Mr. Knightley, I can not feel happiness. In the end, I thought that adaptation would remain true to the book, but with poor actors. It seemed like the movie was made without budget. I would prefer to see the ""lighter"" version with Paltrow and Northam, though it's clear that it was a ""blockbuster"" to ruin all of this script (except for the good Olivia Williams and the better Kate Beckinsale) ,"

I kept on trying to figure out what this film was about, choosing it as its first serious role, but honestly it was a bad choice. I made a good book, but for me as a movie it certainly did not work , I thought it was unbelievable, lacking atmosphere and I found many of the scenes to be staggeringly stilted. A musical maestro, he may be a serious actor of Dylan Mcdermott, and Rose Byrne was passable but not enough to make a weak conspiracy with a weak dialogue. maybe I just missed the point, but for me it did not fit into any genre, it did not arouse any empathy with the characters, nor did it cause any tensions, in fact I prayed myself for the very end and overcome a deep desire, all to beat three main characters!"

Of course, the animation is also excellent and the music captures the feelings in the film perfectly. But the characters are the shining point in this movie: they are so well developed and full of personality. <br /> <br /> Now let me clarify: I'm really talking about the Japanese version of the movie (with English subs). While the English dub is (mostly) good, it simply fades in comparison to the original language version. The voices are better, the dialogue, everything.

But in an eerie twist of fate, her former lover, Sangkwon, plans a getaway for the same destination, where tragedy brings them together once again.","The power of Kangwon province is director Hong Sang-Soo's second feature effort and clearly much of what he has begun in his previous film in this film, including the multiple-connected tales (in this case two) and stories of distressed or troubling relationships , as well as a strong dose of irony. <br /> <br /> One thing that is clearly reduced from his previous work is the flights of the imagination that contain elements of surrealism. However, this film also contains a moment of surreal moment, which contrasts with the otherwise rather realistic depiction. The two stories follow a young woman traveling with her friends to Kangwon province just to feel attracted to a stranger. The second is about a man taking a trip to Kangwon province with his friend and fighting with his relationship. <br /> <br /> Once again, Hong has a strong sense of irony and the flaws in human nature, and yet I do not think he is totally disagreeable with his characters, who are just showing enough compassion He draws criticism with his irony. I think the thoughts that I love about Hong's films are that they just feel so real, especially the complex and contradictory characters. Not to say that every person is a hypocrite or suffering from confused feelings, but that these characters he and the actors present are fully developed and believable. <br /> <br /> This is not a fast paced movie. There's a lot of lingering and like in the previous movie, things do not always connect instantly, so patience pays off in a surprising way. It does not seem to be an element of the film that is not deliberately put into the film, and it makes me a little hyper-aware of various seemingly extra characters as they get drawn into the mix as the movie progresses. > <br /> Power is an excellent movie that manages to bring personal emotions, regrets and yearnings into a story that highlights the irony and fallibility of human choices. It's a pretty heavy balance, and it's surprising how Hong manages to do it twice in a row. Technical production values ​​have become much better since the first film and the direction have become clear. This movie does not pack the same emotional wallop as the first, but it does gain a lot in its safe exploration and the refinement really helps to tighten the overall vision. Great consideration for art cinema lovers. 8.10."

When successful commercial artist Steve Morrow is wrongly suspected of the crimes, his art critic girlfriend Joan Medford decides to follow her instinct about a mysterious bust De Lange has suspiciously covered in his studio, and she decides to snoop around.","This is a typical later universal horror strip: its technically sophisticated, albeit by the numbers, with a cookie-cutter plot and some serious overacting. The most interesting part of this film is his stuntcasting by Rondo Hatton, a man with a bone disorder as the movie's ""monster"". It is sad to see that this man is being exploited, but he probably took good advantage of the money they paid him. Hatton is less frightening than the studio hoped, as I often felt pity for fear or even disgust. Martin Koslack is on board as the crazy artist of the film and he is very amusing in this part. For my part, I enjoy seeing Koslack in almost everything; For some reason, the man amuses me. The only other part of the film that entertained me is the film's absurd attitude to the art world. Here we are shown evil art critics who admire their ability to break artists; this is side by side with the male ""hero"" of the movie, who is an ""artist"" who paints ... brings that ... pin-up girl. Somehow the work of our hero is discussed side by side with the absurd sculpture of the villan. Amusing is also the hideous critic of the film, who once claimed he despised the heroes' pin-up art because ""such women do not exist"", to which our heroine replies with the assurance that the critic just can not get enough out. After all, there is a bit of a subplot about the domestication of the heroine (who is herself an art critic) by the leading man ... totally antifeminist and ridiculous to witness. Overall, this movie is a rather mediocre picture with a few amusing elements."

Please, oh, please do not spoil it by doing a sequel from now on or a prequel. Just leave it alone.

It keeps working and adds a little more. I was delighted to see how well all the information we receive in 'Identity' and 'Supremacy' is interlinked in 'Ultimatum' to finally capture the full picture of Jason Bourne's troubled past. The action sequences are fast paced and keep you on the edge of your place. The battles between Bourne and the assassins are always fun. I have always been a fan of CIA agent films and how the CIA brings their Intel together, and this film is right on this street, which makes it even more exciting for me. <br /> <br /> If you want to watch The Bourne Ultimatum without seeing the previous 2 installments ... you'll enjoy the movie anyway, but I'd still recommend seeing them first. This would allow you to fully understand and be guided by the character Jason Bourne and to be a part of his world. So you can enjoy the movie even more and enjoy. I'm not sure which one is the better of the first 2, but I personally think that ultimatum could, only could, have the advantage of comparing the trilogy."

While it may be a bit simple, you have to play it several times to get all the costumes and comic covers, which is how easy it is to get through the game. It initially seems hard to control, but once you get the hang of it, you'll be web-hauling like Spider-Man himself. <br /> <br /> The bosses, while how the levels are a bit simple, are fun. The first boss, Scorpion, is incredibly easy to beat, which should not be so, as the comic fans know, Scorpion is one of Spider-Man's deadliest villains. The second boss, Rhino, is also very simple. The 3rd boss is Venom, who in my opinion is the lightest boss in the game, which definitely should not be. The fourth boss is Venom again. This time he is a bit harder to beat, but still easy. The fifth boss is Mysterio, who I think is the funniest boss in the game. He's also one of the harder bosses, but again, still pretty easy. The next boss is Carnage, who is easy to beat. But Carnage is actually fun to fight. 7. Boss is Doctor Octopus, who like all other bosses is light but not as easy as the others because he has a shield. The 8th and final boss is exclusive to the game, never in a comic or cartoon. I will not spoil it for you for those of you who have not played the game, but the boss is the only boss in the game who is not too easy. Took me 4 or 5 attempts to beat while the others beat me on the first or second attempt. <br /> <br /> All in all a very good game. I gave him 8 out of 10 points. The reasons why I did not give them a 9 or 10 are that if you get all the costumes and comic covers, it gets boring (getting all the stuff will take a while), it's not very accurate after the comics or the Animated series, the bosses are too easy, and they should have used Hobgoblin and / or Green Goblin as boss, I think it would be fun to fight against someone flying in the air! You also did not use them in the sequel to this game! Well, the Green Goblin is the bad guy in the upcoming Spider-Man movie, so hopefully they'll make a video game based on the movie."

The film has a kind of reckless devotion to the way it was made, which makes the technical mistakes or inconsistencies completely meaningless. Or rather, they are part of the fun, and if the movie had been played seriously, it would not have worked - WHAT IS EXACT WHY PETER JACKSON'S FILM IS Caught. <br /> <br /> He forgot to have fun with the material and let it dictate the result with his army of stupid Power Macintosh pod people animators, and with all his mistakes + Klunker, Kramer's YETI is actually closer to the mind Why do we see films like this, some of which are there to see actors in monkey suits ripping off miniature sets on sound stages, not seamlessly animated, bland hours of nothing but disk space.

Because the movie looks so ""wrong"", you can go through the story and just have fun watching stuff being broken, trampled, thrown around and shattered.

Most of the documentary is spent on propaganda techniques to destroy the space program rather than actually acting.

But in the days of hardcore action, groundbreaking special effects, and complex plots (none of which Bollywood knows), it's refreshing to see a simple movie like Vivah. The story, as we all know, is a journey from the couple's first meeting to their wedding after a few shy moments and trial periods. Not more, not less. The music is not quite in the same league as MPK or HAHK, but neither are the senses. Two songs stood out for me - Mujhe Haq Hai & Do Anjaane. While Milan Abhi Aadha and Hamaari Shaadi were to appease. Shahid is honest and shows a lot of potential. It's good to see that he plays something different from the ""cool guy"" he normally does. Amrita is very sweet and plays the role of a docile small-town girl perfectly. Alok Nath, Anupam Kher & Seema Biswas are great supporters and the rest of the cast is doing a decent job. Suraj's direction is simple but effective. The main flaw of the movie is the slow speed that could test the patience of many young viewers. But all in all a good, clean, decent family movie."

They all have their own problems, such as finance, harrassment, personal safety, and self doubt. Additionally, campus life seems to be causing a problem for everyone: racism. Students, already under pressure to perform in the classroom, on the track, or in front of their friends, are strained to the breaking point by prejudice, inexperience, and misunderstanding.","This was a great movie that had many problems. It was about questions of racism and class. But it also had a message to know oneself and take responsibility for oneself. This film was very deep, with the message that you and only you can control your fate. It has also shown that the only way to fit into society is to know yourself and be familiar with what you are. What others think about you is not important. I think this movie has shown it wonderfully. The actors I think were able to convey every character wonderfully. I just found it amazing how deep the movie really was. At a glimpse, you would not see how deep the movie is, but on a wider view you can see the underlining meaning of the movie."
4,tt0433360,0,"When the daughter Emma of the technical writer Allen Pyke and the photographer Julie is found slashed in the throat and wrists in their locked apartment, the couple decides to move to an isolated cabin in the mountains in Kingspike. Julie is very depressed and blames Allen for the death of Emma. Once in the new home, Julie sees the spirit of Emma in a photo she took in a nearby abandoned prison and she becomes obsessed shooting pictures of poltergeists. Allen is advised to move from the place by the local Jim Payne, and on May 21st, Allen finds that the former dwellers of the cabin have committed suicide, and he investigates the death in the spot and finds that many people died around May 22nd. He decides to move with Julie to a hotel, but she does not want to give up on Emma.","A mourning couple, after losing their daughter, moves to a mountain hut and discovers that there can be ghosts, restless ghosts of past residents committing suicide. Julie Pyke (Cheri Christian) accuses husband Allen (Greg Thompson) of the terrible death of her daughter because she left the door unlocked and the marriage has deteriorated. Julie remains in a zombie state, elicits almost no emotion, is far and deaf, photographs only a nearby abandoned prison and finds a frightening image of a ghoul girl clinging to the bars. Although Allen sees nothing unusual, Julie continues to take pictures and we can see that something is wrong. A local artisan, Jim Payne (Scott Hodges), a rather distant companion who hides a secret, becomes a dangerous threat when it turns out that his dead mother may have something to do with the places that happen to the pykes. In the meantime, the neighbors who sold the pykes in the cabin find victims, the alcoholic Mr Booth's mistreatment of his wife, who come back to haunt him. Allen will conduct an investigation into the history of his hut and try to decipher the mystery around the place. <br /> <br /> Many ghosts are unhappy in the background in this murky, supernatural story of virtually every character. Cheri Christian remains so empty and lost, it's incredibly hard to connect with her despite the fact that you understand her plight. The plot, as often mentioned, remains frustrating because none of the characters are locked exactly. I suppose that's the way it should be in these circumstances, but the difficulties I had were never able to hug the Pykes properly because of their constant detachment. Cheri gets cold and distant as I would expect a mother to lose a child that way, but the icy nature made me plead inwardly to embrace her, which I just never could. I think the right performers, even if the characters go through an emotional uproar, can grasp the hearts of their audience when a humanity reaches us. In this movie, the leads are for some reason unable to do so. I could be, I do not know. I wanted to take care of her, but nothing in the characters pulled my heart strings. Anyway, as the movie continues, Allen slowly reveals certain truths and has to fight back against his wife, who has convinced herself that her daughter is among them and that she will not lose her little girl again. Jim, the fragile neighbor who believes that to stop the haunting spook that plagues the area, he has to kill the pykes becomes a vital threat. The ghosts remain a central part of the film, their presence, especially Jim's mother, is anchored in the distance. The finale reveals to them all how Allen must find help for his wife as he tries to thwart Jim's mission. It was hard for me to get into this subject because I was dissatisfied with the leads and their characters."

Steve Martin, Goldie Hawn and John Cleese in a Neil Simon comedy. Where can you be wrong? Look at the movie and you will find out. <br /> <br /> In fact, Martin, the lead role, is mismatched. He does not make the great slapstick he's known for from films like ""The Jerk,"" but instead plays some sort of intermediate character that does not work. Hawn, playing with nobody is terrible. Cleese is the only even partially funny member. <br /> <br /> To top it off, the plot is pretty stupid. I can not say how much of that has changed, but the characters seem to have the least common sense. They rush through New York, do nothing right and unfortunately nothing funny. Not only is the whole premise totally unbelievable, it seems to give the message that people who do not live in New York are not very bright, a theme that is repeated throughout the film. <br /> <br /> In short, instead If you see it, rent the original ""Odd Couple"" again."

I think it's a very funny movie and excellent entertainment. One must expose his unbelief that a homosexual man and a lesbian woman fall in love, have a child, and live happily together. But it's always wonderful when it's played in a movie and your heart warms up. Is it that impossible? There are many more implausible events described in other films. Acting is good, the script is funny. The only negative comment is that the story could well have ended when the family moves away from their original home instead of continuing to investigate whether the man retains a residual homosexuality."

Maybe I should stop believing in her taste in movies. Anyway, that's typical of girls, but even worse than usual. Once again, the writer has broken the cardinal rule of a movie. He / she has disabled the main character. She starts by being a complete friend at the beginning of her girlfriend, and then finds out that when she turns 30, she is essentially a shy person (with affairs, etc.). Why do we feel for this person? OK, let's say we can get over it. Jennifer Garner is as far from being attractive as you can get without having any kind of deformity. I do not know if it's her or the scribe's fault, but her character goes well beyond my threshold for anger. Here is a tip for future filmmakers: 13-year-olds are NOT entertaining, they are annoying. By far the most embarrassing moment in the movie came when they danced to ""thriller"". Holy crap that was painful. It showed that she practiced this dance in the beginning. That explains why she knows, but a whole club full of people?!? Argh !!! The Macarena would be more believable! Suddenly she is completely incompetent and has no idea how to do her job and nobody notices it? At least Tom Hanks's character on ""Big"" had a job that made sense to a child.

William Hurt is totally miscast as Mr. Rochester. Mr. Rochester is a passionate character, where William Hurt portrays him as an ice block. The same goes for Charlotte Gainsborough.

It looks like they've spent more time, effort and money making the DVD cover than on the actual movie. I really thought that the DVD was turned off with someone's homemade porn until I recognized one of the actors from the cover. This movie looks like someone did it with a hundred bucks and a camcorder and spent half of it on rats. The picture is really clear, but that, along with the very unfortunate lighting, cinematography, if you can call it that, production, acting, if that's actually what they do, and script if they have one, makes this movie worse than an old porn. At least the old porn has a point. This looks like some PETA members have joined forces and decided to make a really disturbing, pointless PSA about animal rights and feelings. So this is not worth the money or time. It has nothing in common with the actual BTK serial killer except the name of the killer and some of the victims.

Unknown to Modesty, they have already killed Louche, and are now hiding in the vault for the money. But nobody present and still alive, in the casino knows the code to open the vault. The vault itself is heavily trapped with explosives so that the attackers can not break through the door as planned. Suddenly Modesty finds herself in a roulette game with gang leader Miklos in a life-threatening situation. <br /> <br /> Comments: This is a review that is unrelated to other published media by Modesty Blaise, as I have neither seen nor read them. The first point I like to do is that this is easily wrongly classified. First and foremost, I thought that was a thriller with a fight between Modesty and Miklos as the main plot. Sure, there are some bursts of action, but they are not really an integral or important part of the story. <br /> <br /> As mentioned in the main story and the main suspense scene, the game is between Modesty and Miklos. It's an innovative and intriguing way to reveal the background of a character, and the story takes place much earlier outside the casino. Someone has said that it is almost like a pilot for a TV series, and the feeling is that it could indeed be used as such. But I found that it was a much better way to introduce a character than many others. I was in no way disappointed with the lack of action, instead I enjoyed this game, the story much more than a simple action movie. <br /> <br /> I think the two main stars, Alexandra Staden and Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau very well. Staden especially portrays Modesty very well and really wears this confident and talented character. <br /> <br /> 7/10"

Angela Landsbury has done a perfect Miss Price while David Thomilson has made a great desperate entertainer love interest. Endings always surprise me and that was no exception. It was neither happy nor sad, although I do not know if that was intended. The dialogue was not great, but considering it was a children's movie, that's fine.

Pickford's close-ups are wonderful. <br /> <br /> Born in Denmark, Jean Hersholt is just wonderful as a villain.

When the astronauts were on the moon, they returned LOT of pounds of rock from the moon - for geological studies. These spread around the world in hundreds of labs testing them. And they all came to the conclusion that they came from the same planet, not from Earth: because the inner isotopes of the primitives are different from those on Earth, but similar to those calculated on the Moon. I.U. the conspiracy theorists never study anything: they only take what fits their theory and ignore the rest. <br /> <br /> Another wrongful claim is that their wind was in the hangar where they shot the moon landing, IE The flag is moving. There is a logical explanation: The astronaut moved it with his hand, so he moved. And what does that prove? Well, if the conspiracy theorists were to study the footage at all, they would see that the flag NEVER moves after the astronaut has allowed it, I.E. the conspiracy theorists are bad scientists, they can not study a subject properly or just study it until they have what they have so that they can lie about it and profit (IE this so-called ""documentary"")). <br /> <br /> There is an assertion that it was not possible to be filmed on the moon because all the shadows come from different places, because there are different sources of light, the artificial lighting from the studio. Once again, the conspiracy theorists are wrong (as always), the same would happen at night in a desert, without light sources. But I doubt that any conspiracy theorists ever kept a star trek convention outside of their grandmothers cellar for more than how many days. <br /> <br /> The conspiracy theorists are in denial, big time.

As far as I know, gun laws in America are different from state to state, but no arms shops sell anti-tank weapons over the counter.

They used to be close friends but their differing lifestyles and ambitions, especially that of Anton Newcombe, have forced them apart, to the point of being enemies.","A documentary about two rock bands spanning several years. Brian Jonestown Massacre and the Dandy Warhols. What makes it special is the confrontation with the complex contrasting personalities and the ironies of success and failure. <br /> <br /> Anton Newcombe, the lead actor of Brian Jonestown Massacre, is not only regarded by him as a musical genius colleague, his friends and rivals the dandy Warhols, but also record producers and most of the people who have worked with him , Unfortunately, he and his bandmates are also unable to integrate into the real world. Newcombe selects fights with band members on stage or with members of the audience (arrested at one point because he literally enters a fan's head). Newcombe knows no boundaries? he plays between 40 and 100 different instruments, writes and produces all BJM music, can produce enough songs to fill an entire album in a single day, has a prophetic obsession with his own musical genius, but is also a strong drug user, At the slightest compromise of his own artistic integrity, he rages, commands his band members as if they were lesser forms of life, and can ruin business as quickly as he does. BJM go through a large number of record labels in quick succession? They register them as soon as they recognize Newcombe's talents and release them as soon as they realize he is completely uncontrollable. <br /> <br /> The Warhols acknowledge their guilt in Newcombe's creativity and do not even put themselves in the world like lofty sphere of greatness? but the Warhols have something that BJM does not do? the ability to connect their talents with common sense, the real world and their marketplace? as a mix of talent (though much of it is distilled by guru newcombe) and accessibility, they are the real definition of ""cool."" Dig! follows the parallel careers of both bands with increasing sharpness. At one point, Newcombe stunts designed to generate publicity send seeming death threats and hate messages to the Warhols (in a box containing live ammunition and insults like a bar of soap to clean up their act)? He only forgets to tell them that it is a trick and they become so paranoid that they issue a restraining order against Newcombe. By the time the Dandy Warhols in Europe start with hits like ""Every day should be a holiday"" and ""Bohemian like you"", Newcombe is becoming more and more isolated. BJM are stopped and the band collapses when arrested for possession of marijuana? The Warhols are killed at about the same time because of drugs, released with a warning, and even allowed to keep the grass. <br /> <br /> The broad appeal of DiG! is that the genius versus accessibility lessons go way beyond two bands or even rock music. The downside is that it's still a documentary, even if it's intimate, and it will mostly appeal only to dedicated movie fans or people who are already interested in the music of one or both of the bands listed. Newcombe may be a largely unrecognized genius, and in the film there is a glimpse of it, but for the untouched ear there is little more than the claims of the interviewees confirming that. In the words of one of the band members: ""In every spiritual tradition you burn in hell because you pretend to be God and unable to support it.""

An unanticipated uproar from the students and community ensued. Moore protestors claimed university funds should not pay for Moore's visit, while those in support of Moore fought to defend free speech. A community once considered politically passive was stirred to action, and the conflict played out in the media and several public forums. Those opposed to Moore's visit, in an effort to have the invitation rescinded, resorted to death threats, petitions, law suits, and bribery. Moore supporters, living in the high concentrate of Mormon conservatism, struggled to be heard, to defend new ideas, and to keep plans for his visit on track.

Moore has the expertise to distract the viewer from this focus, while Greenstreet is obviously less qualified here. <br /> <br /> Since I was privy to all matters relating to Moore's speech at UVSC, I was disappointed that it was the major complaints of the community - that Moore was paid $ 40,000 of Utah's education allowance to John Kerry Promoting the campaign and promoting his own liberal film - were pushed into the background by Greenstreet, while minor problems were sensationalized. The marketing methods for this video were equally biased and reprehensible ... promoting the film with the claim that ""Mormon is trying to kill Moore"". This is not only absurd but also slanders an important religion with which Greenstreet obviously has some personal problems. I followed Moore's visit very closely, and all the major news agencies found Moore's visit came and went away with no credible security issues or incidents in Utah. <br /> <br /> Greenstreet has put on this film to start its film career to the point that he even left the film school to accelerate that. However, this seems to have been a grave miscalculation, as Moore's visits to approximately 60 other colleges and universities across the country in 2004 diluted interest in this more common event. Greenstreet's assumption that the American public would be interested in this film because of the promoted religious and conservative perspectives does not seem to be well founded. <br /> <br /> The name of the movie, This Divided State, is a bit of a misnomer since Utah overwhelmingly voted in favor of Bush's re-election, and thus seems to be more politically consistent than any other state. The division into the movie title seems more likely to point to the divide that exists in Greenstreets ideological differences with its religion and its state. If anything, I find a humorous connection between the religious aspect of this supposed documentary and Woody Allen's hilarious claims in Sleeper (1973): ""I was beaten up by Quakers."""

Essentially, it's not about anything because the two main characters are overthrown by a hate of the world in their own world of nothingness. The brilliance here is how the director arouses interest throughout most of the run with just two characters and when the only staging is half a house and a huge white, empty space.

I know that sounds ironic, but the wage advantages are far more rewarding. <br /> <br /> Everyone would see you around Tim and immediately think of ""Tool Time"". They would even get roles with Bob Vila more often. Instead, appear for 10 minutes with a Golden Retriever and smile. I know that there was not much of a script, but you could have added it. I mean, come on. Tim owes you one. <br /> <br /> But seriously, this movie does not do anything for the Air Bud line.

Stewart and Miles (as his wife) are pretty good, as is Hamilton as a serious agent. The problem is that the episodic nature of the story makes it difficult to get involved. It's like watching a dozen different films bit by bit as we take a look at a gangster commercial. Some of the episodes are too long, some too short, and some just look out of place (Stewart's Daughter School). Overall, it is far too long.

But her background makes it impossible for her to trust Dean Cain, and that destroys it in the end. It sounds weird, but I like the position in which Dean Cain was at the end and the choice he made. He can not hurt her because he loves her and she is the mother of his child (I think the timeframe makes it clear that it is his child and not his brother), but at the same time he can not forgive her for everything she did has to sleep with his brother (which shows the love and commitment he felt was kind of like) and then to be part of his death.

The contradictions about the emergence of technology are a crucial issue here, do we want inventions that save us assets while we close the industry? You just have to see what happened to the UK coal industry to know what it's all about. The decade the film was filmed is a crucial point to realize that producing nuclear weapons has become more than hearsay, and science has developed into alarmingly new proportions.

The sound and setting are huge, the direction is seamless, and the sound shift is cleverly handled by Mackendrick. Some of the scenes are just wonderful, one attracts the heartbands and recalls a certain scene in David Lynch's Elephant Man about 29 years later, and after such a downturn of events, the movie still manages to take a wink as the genius, that Alec Guinness closes the film, not just to give viewers the future of Stanley, but the rest of us in this fast-moving world. <br /> <br /> A timeless masterpiece, thematically and as a work of art, 10/10."

Does she go to the police and risk being called a liar? Or does she kill him - and become as low as him?","Kudos to Fawcett for taking roles that were considered controversial at the time. In my mind, rape in the 1980s was still a taboo subject, and women's rights and feelings were rarely studied so deeply during that time. <br /> <br /> Fawcett is just a woman who is being followed, followed by actor James Russo. He is adequate as the obsessed psychopath, but sometimes a bit transparent. <br /> <br /> Diana Scarwid has a small role, as does Alfre Woodard as a house mate. Woodard worries about the legal consequences if Fawcett, the rape victim, avenges the culprit. The scene where she throws a pan of hot oil at Russo is classic and as a rapist he deserves it. She then holds him in bondage, and the consequences must be confronted. <br /> <br /> A very real story that reflects the emotions and rage of rape victims who have been physically and mentally injured.

In 1955, Bettie Page (1923-2008 ) waits to testify before a Senate subcommittee investigating the effects of pornographic material on American adolescents and juveniles. In flashbacks, we see her childhood in Tennessee, a brief marriage, a gang rape, and her going to New York City in 1949. There she takes acting lessons, models for photos, and acts in short films for adults, earning the nickname, ""The Pin-Up Queen of the Universe."" We see her relationship with merchants Irving and Paula Klaw, photographers John Willie and Bunny Yeager, boyfriends, and the public. Through it all, she is wholesome, sporting, and forthright - Eve before the fall.","THE SPECIAL BEDDY PAGE (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> Mol appears as a legendary pinup queen Bettie Page in a fine biopic. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol has been known to be reprimanded as The Next-It-Girl a few years ago, especially when no-one knew who she was, despite a notorious cover story by Vanity Fair among other media -Dubbings, but despite some co-starring here and there, her predicted fame seemed even less bright. Here, like the famous pin-up queen Bettie Page, Gretchen Mol is indeed a shining star on the rise. <br /> <br /> Bettie Page was born in Tennessee as a God-fearing and family-oriented, real girl herself the unjustified object of lust and affection as she grew older. A criminal gang rape is not graphically portrayed, and even the subtle portrayal of her own father has not quite as good designs for his own relatives, which is important to understand how Page mysterious life for a career could escape an actress who Traveling to New York City in the 1950s, in fact, was the time and place to catch the lights in a bottle. What Page did not know was that it was exactly when she arrived. <br /> <br /> A beautiful, raven-black treasure with a divine figure. Page is seen by a black policeman on a summer's day on Coney Island with a request to take her picture, causing her to pose in his basement and finally to the studios of Irving Klaw (Bauer) and his sister Paula (Taylor) who devote their kitschy yet pornographic stills to a unique clientele: fetish types. <br /> Although Page is pretty naïve, she is undeniably smart and knows that her body is not a sin and can see the forest for the trees in the sense that she is in control - or at least sticking with what you do is offered to work that it is not indecent and she amused herself in her increasingly understated portraits - until a witch hunt in Congress is looking for some scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime. <br /> <br /> The talented filmmaker Mary Harron and her screenwriting partner Guinevere Turner (""An American Psycho"" and ""I Shot Andy Warhol"") streamline biopic productions quite neatly and perhaps a bit premature to be who they really are was Bettie Page, though they do justice to represent a time of tension in their zenith. A big thank you goes to the gifted cameraman Mott Hopfel for his black-and-white images and speckled color segments reminiscent of Douglas Sirk films reminiscent of melodramatic lighters. Part Feminist Contract and Part American Dream made the story chug beautifully with fine performances by his ensemble including comic peasant and Taylor as siblings in Dirt and Harris with a field day as colleagues fotog with a taste for wine and chatter. It is amusing to see Strathairn as a senator in a campaign for justice, after portraying New Bulldog Edward R. Murrow on his recent excursion ""Good Night and Good Luck"" as a counterpart to the table role. > <br /> But beware of the truly fine talents of Mol as the uninhibited, but deeply moral and, above all, intelligent Bettie Page, who lets her childlike innocence shine through her bold nudity and now considers it tame and hilarious. Borderline kitschy poses that have been holding man's imagination captive for decades and are still a bookmark for human sexuality in this country and perhaps the world. Mol is perfect and eerily resembles the theme of her portrait to her knowing-whimsical smile. The real Bettie Page was allegedly not involved in the project, but apparently she gave her blessing and continues to live a secluded life that is alluded to in the final moments that she found Jesus and repulsed her ""infamous"" image once and for all. A shame, since this film strangely embraces and exudes the piercing decency that has infiltrated its theme that all can see in its naked splendor."

He's a killer now and George does not really know what he's doing professionally. I think you can do the rest. <br /> <br /> The part of the film that troubled me is that I can not believe that Gladys George could not figure it out. She is a street smart girl, her part is very similar to the one she played in the Roaring Twenties opposite James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Speaking of The Roaring Twenties, Humphrey Bogart's character development is similar to Tone, although he was not the central character of the film. In fact, there are elements of They Gave Him A Gun that can be found in Taxi Driver and in Clint Eastwood's classic The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> The fighting sequences of the First World War are very well staged by director Woody Van Dyke. For some reason, Leonard Maltin shot this movie, I think it's much better than he let it be."

Cutting between three major scenes, including the Rolling Stones in the studio, the film is visually intercut with Eve Democracy (Wiazemsky) using graffiti which amalgamates organisations, corporations and ideologies. Godard also examines the role of the revolutionary within Western culture. Although he believes Western culture needs to be destroyed, it can only be done so by the rejection of intellectualisation. ""There is only one way to be an intellectual revolutionary, and that is to give up being an intellectual""","The film school intellect can do anything they want about the important (imaginary) meaning of this movie, but it's just that: intellectual drool. This movie is bankrupt creatively, and some confuse it with endless, indulgent wanking as a substance. Yes. <br /> <br /> Obviously Godard was not a Stones fan. Too bad, because that could have been great. He catches the birth of this timeless song and instead chooses the music with a guy reading from a True Detective mag or crap. <br /> <br /> Then there are the endless shots of something that looks like the 1960s librarians painting words on people's cars. And then there's the seemingly never-ending ""interview"" in which the actress was brilliantly instructed to answer only yes or no to all the really deep and intellectual questions. There's a guy in a purple suit reading more crap out of a book that lasts for, oh, only about 20 minutes.

When he finds that his equally destitute sweetheart Katie has been reduced to prostitution, he succumbs to temptation and betrays his former comrade Frankie to the British authorities for a 20 pound reward. In the course of one gloomy, foggy night, guilt and retribution inexorably close in...","I have no doubt that Victor McLaglen won his Oscar for Best Actor for this film because he split three times among the bounties of Clark Gable, Charles Laughton and Franchot Tone. But The Informer is still a good movie because John Ford would not have gotten his first Oscar for Best Director if it had not been for him. No division into his award. <br /> <br /> The film and story of Liam O'Flaherty on which he is based includes a poor fool from a man named Gypo Nolan, who was once a member of the Irish Republican Army. He was taken out of the register for a moronic trick he had to pull and get back. He's on his last penny and if he can not come back, he wants enough for the passage to America.

Kerrigan is played. <br /> <br /> The whole act of informer takes place in Dublin in 1922 from about six in the evening to the next morning. A necessity shoots it in the dark and shadow, perhaps making it the first noir thriller. If it had been done after the Second World War, the Informer could have been considered a great Noir classic, like Odd Man Out or The Third Man, which is very similar. <br /> <br /> John Ford knew this world very well.

His real name before he became anglicised was Sean O'Fiernan. <br /> <br /> Preston Foster plays IRA commander Dan Gallagher. In the book, Gallagher is a harder and meaner man than Foster has him here. I suspect that John Ford wanted him as a sympathetic character to arouse the movie fans an interest. He makes it clear that Foster will have to eliminate the informer because the Black and Tans will grab him and get a little bit more out of him and endanger the whole organization. <br /> <br /> The IRA Trials Scene is the highlight of the film. When Foster asks Donald Meek if he recognizes the authority of her court, Meek is unable to say no. The justice and the jurisdiction of the king do not run here. It shows clearly that the British, despite occupation by army troops and gendarmerie, in fact lose their influence on the population. <br /> <br /> Of course, The Informer has a rather bleak story, but has fewer John Ford touches than you would expect. Even as McLaglen spends his money on a drunken lane, the IRA is constantly in the shadows watching every penny. <br /> <br /> The Informer is a story told in a grim and bleak time about Ireland."

Everyone needs to get away from it all, and the country is the most tranquil place to escape life's everyday battles. Or is it? Richard and Janet, a city couple, find that just the opposite is true as their weekend getaway is transformed into a frightening and primitive wilderness. Camping for the night in a seemingly abandoned farmhouse, the two are suddenly joined by strangers who have been secretly watching them all afternoon. Strangers who will soon cage Richard like a trapped animal and ravage his wife. Strangers who will drive Richard berserk in the cold and inhuman isolation of Caged Terror.","I saw this movie a few years ago. I could not sleep and there was nothing. So I saw it. What really appeals to me is that it makes no sense and is therefore annoying. Richard gets tied up in chicken wire and Jarvis starts snapping around with Richards girl while she's unconscious. Then Jarvis's buddy Troubador plays a stupid song on his guitar. The next morning Richards girl will talk to Jarvis and Trouby and then she goes back to Richard and looks at him while he is still tied up. Then they play happy music and the film is ready. I mean, what happened? Did you stop? And what did she say to these 2 guys (Trouby and Jarvis)? It is too puzzling and too poor too. I can not stand movies that are disturbing and make no sense. This was the worst movie I've seen since Lord of the Flies's 90s version."

The unnecessary noises of the city interrupt his life to the point that he takes a baseball bat to the windshield of cars whose alarms are blaring. After a few arrests, his wife kicks him out. On his own, he learns to avoid arrest and leaves a calling card as ""The Rectifier"" when he breaks into an offending car. Gruska, an enterprising young reporter, tracks him down. He tells her his story, they become lovers, and she organizes a petition drive for a ballot initiative to ban car alarms. The mayor becomes the Rectifier's bête noire. Can David fight City Hall and win?","This is one of the topics that I can identify with a little more than most people, because I hate noise and have no idea how those in big cities, especially New York, sleep at all! It baffles me that people today can handle all the noise outside. The basic plot of the film is that it is an interesting topic. It is a pity that this is about it. Tim Robbbins is decent, except for a few scenes (especially with the absolute supermodel who sees Margarita Leiveva), he did not seem to be really there. My biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning and talented actress, Margarita Levieva. She does not have much to do, but she is super cute. Even if they try to look at more girls next door. It saddens me that there are people like Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian in the world who have no solvable skills or talents to have more fame and success than this talented beauty. I did not like this movie very much because the script is not very good, but I'm glad I saw some new talent. I hope producers and directors think about Margarita when they need a beautiful new actress to be in their big budget movie. If she can make Megan Fox a star (she's not that hot and her acting talent is worse than Disney Channel TV shows) from a movie, it should be easy for her as she is beautiful and talented ! I would recommend her to change her surname so that we can pronounce her and make her more marketable. I hope this will make her career, and if there is justice she can turn up in some big summer movies over the next few years."

The money is soon stolen from him, and he embarks on a killing spree in an attempt to retrieve it.","Ed Wood fans are primarily an obsessive bunch, but this movie has driven me to a fan base I've never seen before! One of the most intense thrills of non-mainstream movie flattery - at least as far as I'm concerned - is the pleasure of discovering the dark. I remember that as a teenager, I wanted to see Eddie's ""Revenge of the Dead"" (the ""Night of the Ghouls""), which had been in the vault for a few decades at the time. Likewise, such arcane masterpieces of low budget filmmaking as Doris Wishman's ""A Night to Dismember"" or half of the works of Jesus Franco! In the last few years video and DVD have made these once incomprehensible treasures almost accessible - even to those of us on the ""wrong"" (!) Side of the Atlantic .... <br /> <br /> And then, see, there was ""I woke up early in the day when I died"" - a movie that was supposed to be SO, but disappeared into the air even before Fangoria printed the first rather long article about it, which first made me hungry. The 1990s NEEDED a hard-to-find movie that would REALLY pay off. And that 's for sure ... I do not want to add too many comments to all these wonderful aspects of the film - its classic yet kitschy cast, its haunting but often hallucinogenic images, its wondrous moments of ""pure cinema"" (in the sense of the French cineastes of the 1920s) and surrealism or even his most memorable soundtrack - because all this eloquently described by other users here. <br /> <br /> What I would like to briefly mention is the joy that I have received by finding certain obscure artifacts relating to this almost-lost-to-us - but - thank goodness - not very movie! I think the German video I recorded on a cold, fresh winter day in Cologne is pretty well known by Ed Wood's followers. It is also common knowledge that a billboard has been published for the film. Fortunately, there is more to find !!! For one thing, there are a number of reviews from the film's German THEATRICAL release - I've used several of them in my translation classes to ""reify"" my students ... some of these critiques are positive eulogies on the film's artistry and entertainment value - and Most interesting of all, most critics have placed it directly in the American Trash and European Arthouse traditions. Secondly, there is the score of Larry Groupe ', which can be purchased by the man himself - many of the tracks exert a truly emotional attraction on the listener, especially considering the current ""arched"" status of the movie and becoming a little melancholy same time. Finally, for the time being, I would like to mention Promo SOUNDTRACK, which released Cinequanon in extremely limited numbers. BEG, BORROW, STEAL, KILL or do whatever it takes when you get the chance to buy one !!!!!! It contains 14 pieces from the film, including Eartha Kitts Ballad, Darcy Clay's ""Jesus I Was Evil"" (two versions are also available on New Zealand CD, though that's another story!), The cool radio music to which Christina Ricci dances, and also these fantastic techno-drops by Minty and ZHV (the latter is Billy Z's own techno band) ..... <br /> <br /> Become obsessed - let Ed Wood rule your life."
8,tt0037136,1,The career of a Nazi officer shown as flashbacks from his trial as a war criminal.,"The only reason I give this movie an 8 out of 10 is that, in my opinion, there are few films that are perfect. This little B picture is an exciting story, well told. Alexander Knox has always fascinated me, but I have only seen him a few films. Here he plays Wilhelm Grimm, a sad little man who turns into a monster. He betrays everything and everyone without remorse. The performance is one of the coolest performances I've ever seen. Since World War II, actors who play Nazi or other evil-type films have occasionally been nominated for Oscars. I imagine the Academy, being made during the war, felt as if it were honoring a performance as if it were honoring evil. But this kind of accomplishment brings Knox in - a man so bitter and consumed with guilt that he does not care to make others suffer. I still can not get over it. <br /> <br /> Marsha Hunt, who normally plays the Filbert gallows or the social butterfly, will probably be against the type in probably the best performance I've ever seen. Maybe not Oscar-worthy, but the best of her career. Nothing against her; I enjoyed them in those ""small"" roles she has often played. But here she proves that she is up to the task of heavier drama. <br /> <br /> If you love human drama stories or stories about the fate of those who suffered from the Nazis, I recommend this fine little movie."

10,tt0475101,1,"Writer/Director Alex Ferrari and writer/producer Jorge F. Rodriguez, a filmmaking duo that hails straight from Hollywood - Hollywood, Fla., that is - recently joined the wave of ultra-low-budget proto-Spielbergs with their revolutionary short film Broken, an action/sci-fi piece complete with explosions, automatic weapons, and a stylish, neo-noir look that isn't all that far removed from its main stylistic inspiration, the Matrix trilogy. This making-of documentary for the short film BROKEN (2005). It is extremely informative clocking in at almost three hours. We are presented with interviews with the director, cast members and special effects artists, who give their insights into the efforts that were needed to bring this $8000 project to completion.","As a low-budget company, where the filmmakers themselves produce and distribute the DVDs, perhaps we should not expect too much from the broken-in-disc form. And most notable of all this achievement is the fact that this release has enough extras to spot a James Cameron DVD and a very nice presentation. <br /> <br /> With regard to the latter, the only big mistake is that Broken comes with a non-anamorphic transmission. Otherwise, we get the movie in its original ratio of 1.85: 1, show no technical flaws and look like you should expect. Considering the fact that Ferrari reaches out when assembling this disc, one can actually guarantee such a fact. <br /> <br /> The same goes for the soundtrack. Both DD2.0 and DD5.1 ​​mixes are offered here, and while I'm unsure what should be considered ""original"", the fact that Ferrari was involved in both things should not be considered inferior. In fact, although the DD5.1 ​​offer more atmosphere viewing experience due to the way in which it uses the score, both are equally good and free of technical defects. <br /> <br /> As for extras, the disc is positively overwhelmed by them. Look at the sidebar on the right side of the screen and you'll notice lots of comments, lots of featurettes and different galleries. Given the way in which everything has been broken up into tiny pieces and not put together for a long documentary, there is really little to discuss. For example, the ""Anatomy of a Stunt"" motive is exactly what it claims to be, and the same goes for the rest of the pieces. As such, we receive coverage of just about every aspect of pre-production, production and post-production of Broken. And while it might have been preferable to find them in a more digestible ""making of"", we have easy access to everything we desire. <br /> <br /> Of the different pieces, maybe it's just the comments that need some kind of discussion. On the other hand, there is also predictable air for each of the chat tracks. The one with the actors is overly joking and does not take the movie too seriously. Ferrari's pieces are unbelievably enthusiastic about the whole thing. And the technical ones are, well, extremely technical. Of course, we also get some crossover with what has been discussed elsewhere on the discs, but in just 19 minutes, all these pieces are no longer welcome. All in all, a nice extras package."

The atmosphere is fantastic and the story original and entertaining. I especially like the scenes in which the RV is attacked in the desert. The Rocks are indeed convincing for such a low budget strip. The drama is above average for these types of films and the music is scary. This is definitely a jewel of jewels. I recommend it to anyone who likes these strange movies from the late seventies, early eighties, like ""Alice, Sweet Alice"", ""Poorly Pretty Eddie"", ""Nightmare"", ""Hospital Massacre"" and ""Return of the Aliens, the Deadly Spawning"" , Definitely a classic !!"

The constant left-dribbling could have annoyed me if I had not been prepared for it before; Sutherland greets his family and friends about possible filming ideas for his next film, and most of these ideas are about either blacks or Indians (of course he would be greeted with open arms in today's Hollywood). One of his movie ideas is about a black uprising in Beverly Hills - sort of a racial war in the middle of L.A. This is the kind of nonsense Mazursky thinks when writing scripts for his films. Fortunately, some of Sutherland's hippie friends make fun of this premise of the Black Revolution, and the resulting dialogue is not bad; A little later, the Jew argues over Sutherland as he makes a movie about ""masturbation and the black problem"" as he talks about masturbation. Another funny moment is when Sutherland's older daughter with her white schoolmates plays a PC crap on stage and they all say, ""We, the Blacks of the Republic of South Africa ..."". <br /> <br /> There's always a certain amount of lawlessness when Hollywood shoots a movie about Hollywood - especially when Hollywood shoots a movie about Hollywood discussing movies in Hollywood. Well, that's really very, very forgiving. The scene with Fellini (playing herself) is more amusing than annoying. Mazursky throws in the usual flower children and anti-Vietnam crap and makes fun of corporate Hollywood, but he's also part of the ""Phony Hollywood"" (lyrics in the surreal war) segment like any other; I'm pretty sure he's doing the wrong little talk at Beverly Hills parties and grinning badly as he shakes hands with people he either does not know or likes, but does not want the money for his next (left) project) , As for his hair, he has the worst hair I've seen in a long time (on film or elsewhere); It's kind of like the kind of long hair a middle aged accountant would have if he grew it long. The film remains relatively interesting despite its aimlessness, but somewhat boring in the last third.

Without food, water, ammunition and medical supplies, only two hundred men survive after five days of siege.","When this film was first shown on television, I had high hopes that we would finally have a decent movie about World War I, as experienced by American soldiers. That's not it. <br /> <br /> It should be a good movie about the First World War. Although it was made for television, it is obvious that a real effort has been made to use appropriate equipment and props. But the writing and the direction are missing very much, even if the makers of this film obviously borrowed from some well-made war films. War movie stereotypes abound, like the arrogant general who apparently does not care about the lives of his men. When will Hollywood realize that although there were many bad generals, most of the combat unit's generals themselves have seen much fighting and are not naive about what the average grunt experiences? The first part of this movie seemed to be ""Paths of Glory"" with American uniforms. Except that ""Paths of Glory"" was emotionally enthralling. Later there was Chamberlain's accusation (except uphill) of ""Gettysburg"" and even the capture of the American soldier by a ring of enemy soldiers from ""The Thin Red Line"". But in ""The Thin Red Line"" the soldier was alone trapped. In this film, in the middle of a battle, a ring is formed around the new prisoner. <br /> <br /> If this movie uses a military advisor, ignore it. Although the actors (and I never forgot they were actors while watching) formed military tactics, I did not see much of it. The American soldiers got up to be shot while the Germans attacked. And the notorious stormtroopers, who seemed to be blind, did not seem to use tactics in their attack. In real war tactics was what made the stormtroopers so effective. But the dumbest scene was the attack of German flamethrowers. In this scene, the German flamethrower in a broad line towards the defending Americans. If that had been real, they would never have come close enough to use their flamethrowers before they were all thrown off the defenders' bullets. <br /> <br /> Okay, most war movies are unrealistic when it comes to tactics. But it is still disappointing. But what really distracted me from this streak was the typical anti-military point of view that filmmakers consider important. True, war is hell. But most American soldiers, though they grumble and complain, tend to believe in what they do and can be pretty coddled about it. My grandfather served in the First World War. And although he died four years before my birth, I was told how proud he was of his service."

The director approved and subsequently repudiated this version.,"<br /> <br /> An old man works as a janitor in a psychiatric ward to be near his wife, who is patient and tries to get her out. <br /> <br /> This is certainly one of the most forgotten silent era masterpieces and a curiosity in the history of Japanese cinema. Long thoughts lost, a print was found in the 70s and a music soundtrack was added, which fits perfectly with the pictures. It might have been affected by the Cabinet of Doctor Caligary (director Kinugasa claimed that he never saw the German movie). However, it surpasses it stylistically and in its more convincing (and cooler) portrayal of the inner state of mind of inmates in asylum. To achieve this, the film uses every single film technique available at the time: multiple exposures and blurred subjective viewing angles, tilted camera angles, fast and slow movements, expressionistic lighting, and overlaying among others. It's also a very complicated movie to follow as it has no subtitles. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a montage of rain shells hitting the windows of the hospital, wind shaking trees and thunder. The disturbing weather metaphorizes the mental state of the patients and introduces one of them: a former dancer. The combination of sounds produced by rain, wind and thunder serves as music that causes the dancer to enter into a hectic, almost hypnotic dance. In another sequence, in which the same patient plays another raging dance, she is watched by other inmates. Multiple exposures of the dancer represent the patient's perspective and their confused ""view"" on the world. These are just two examples from this amazing movie that seeks to portray the subconscious and the patient's view of the ""healthy"" world. <br /> <br /> You have to see in three words."

When I saw the movie, I felt that the script could be taken and with a few minor updates, again, and unfortunately it would still fit in with contemporary events. But the remake would not be nearly as good. A great performance by Victor McLaglen (for which he rightly won an Academy Award) and a stellar ensemble cast that includes most, if not all, actors with brogues in Hollywood at the time, are most of them recognizable character actor, then or straight were founded starting. A very good movie, worth seeing. Highly recommended."

And there's nothing to see - the FX'es look like they're from a second-hand store, usually seen in other movies. But it's definitely a good lullaby."

Tom Berenger plays another rugged, unconventional military guy and William McNamara plays his rookie-out to be well-played. The plot on the face is absurd because I forgot the time Eleniak should have had and could have escaped, but this is an entertaining movie to feel good and there are good cameos from all the above actors keeping the movie going.

Some of Moore's drunken scenes are forced, parts of the film are shaky, but the cast plays with so much enjoyment that it's a difficult movie to resist. It has a very big heart and gives Academy Award winner John Gielgud a sly, dry amusing role as Arthur's servant, Hobson; his relationship with Arthur is delicious and they have a wondrous relationship.

The cast of Oscar winner Juliette Binoche as Dan's love interest was an excellent choice; She is exceptionally talented, intelligent, naturally attractive and, thank God, aged accordingly! Had this movie been shot with Jessica Alba or Scarlett Johansson, that would have been a disaster. <br /> <br /> Another wonderful aspect of ""Dan in Real Life"" is that it's a perfect movie for adults interested in a mature comedy that omits the three pillars of the ""frat pack"" formula: stupid girls, chauvinist types and greasy jokes. ""Dan in Real Life"" is funny and has fun, smart laughs everywhere. While other comedies are based on jokes or based almost exclusively on jokes that make the audience laugh, the jokes in ""Dan in Real Life"" are more natural and clever, and bring with them some reflection on the part of the audience. <br /> <br /> My only problem with ""Dan in Real Life"" is that actress Brittany Robertson's rebellious middle-class daughter is too rude to play. It's hard to say if this was a personal decision or a decision of the director. However, her character is unrealistic and annoying. But that's just a small mistake in the movie and does not take the story as a whole. <br /> <br /> All in all, ""Dan in Real Life"" is a great movie, a fantastic escape from the redundancy of insulting and stupid comedies. The quality of writing, governing, acting and (especially) cinematography is excellent. It's just a nice, carefree comedy."

Philip takes her back again when she returns with her baby. She wrecks his apartment and burns the securities he needs to pay tuition. He gets a job as a salesman, has surgery on his foot, receives an inheritance, and returns to school where he learns Mildred is dying.","This movie is about sexual obsession. Bette Davis plays Mildred. This is a woman to whom men are attracted. Not because she is a beautiful, beautiful girl, but because she is a sexual entity. Now the movie does not come out and says that but it's obvious. There is a scene in the movie where men are all about them. She works as a waitress in a cafe, she can not read and she is not really someone she can look at, but she is a flirt. It is obvious that the male customers in this cafe are there for her. One day, Phillip, a failed clump-footed medical student, comes to the store to say a good word for his friend, but he gets doted as soon as he sees her. He begins to buy her things, even pays for her apartment. In the meantime, she sees other people and she makes no secrets about it. He dreams of her as if she were an angel, but she is not an angel. He keeps thinking about her. His Med school grades are even failed. So what the Nookie is too good. He wants to marry her, but she rejects him because she marries another man. She always lets Phil know that she has no feelings of love for him all the time. He is broken, but he meets another woman. They seem to be good, but it's obvious he's still dreaming of the Bimbo.

Oh, we have a clubfoot he's having trouble with, even though a teenager on the street who has the same problem tells him to make fun of it. He meets another girl named Sally, we have a montage of March time that shows her aging as he continues her and is still waiting for Mildred. Well, he has no schooling, can not find a job. Eventually, Sally and her father pick him up. Not before another assembly in March of the time that shows him the descent. Soon his uncle, who raised him, dies and he gets money to become a doctor. Meanwhile, he finds that Mildred needs him again. She has TB. In the meantime, he still leads Sally the Primrose way over the marriage and he takes a job on a steamer. Eventually the bimbo dies and Phillip declares that he is now free and will marry Sally. I wish she had told him to stuff it. Now I know that my attitude to the characters will not bring me any points. But I think Phillip was the bad guy. Yes, Mildred is a trumpet BUT he knows and he always comes back. Mean, while he has two other girlfriends who love him, but he treats as appetizers. I think the sex was not so good. But in any case, he watches over those women who wait for Mildred. Not only that, the man who gets Mildred pregnant is already married, and when Philip asks him what he wants to do with baby (apparently the baby's name), he laughs, he has no intention of supporting her and baby and he is wealthy. Sally's father, who has 9 children, says some pretty bad things about women, but he's supposed to be an old traditionalist. Even Philip does not seem to disprove his feelings. Men use Mildred as a boy's toy, but the men in this movie get away with it. Yes, she was not a respectable woman, but far from a villain. For me it's Philip who had the real problem and it was his sexual obsession for Mildred."

So when Anthony accepts to play Othello, he devotes himself entirely to the part, but it soon overwhelms him and with each day his mind gets filled more and more with Othello's murderous jealousy.","If an actor has to play the role of an actor, fictional or factual, the task becomes much more difficult than playing a role. In A Double Life, Ronald Coleman beat himself as Anthony John, the tortured double personality. He has put all his talent and sincerity into this character. The countenance, mannerisms, gait, and attitude spoke eloquently of what Anthony John was going through as he played Othello on stage. Coleman was also very good as a Shakespearean actor in the short scenes like Othello, which were part of this movie. Collisions of Coleman's face, when Othello was tormented by doubts about Desdemona's loyalty, were scenes worth considering. In addition, his off-stage character is desperate, and only someone with Coleman's depth can achieve the acting's perceptions. It was like I was Spenser Tracy as Dr. Watching Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, except that this dual role was much deeper and more moving. Shelly Winters looked so cute, vulnerable, and gorgeous, and added her talent to the movie. It is believed that Ronald Coleman liked his role in this film above all else he played and in 1947 won the Oscar for Best Actor. I would watch this movie repeatedly and never feel bored."

The woman (Virginia Bryant) has recurring dreams of herself as a little girl walking down the old wine cellar of this mansion, encountering this cocoon-like structure hanging from the ceiling. It glows and is covered with cobwebs and has something that looks like spider or insect legs hanging from it. It drips what looks like green paint. <br /> <br /> Of course, the husband does not believe in it. The villa is just old and creaky and makes strange noises in the middle of the night and she should just ignore it. <br /> <br /> But then the OGRE itself appears in something that looks like a kind of 16th Centaury costume with what looks like a wolf's head attached to it that attracts the scent of orchids. <br /> <br /> The films are not really that bad and at least the dialogue is reasonably intelligent without the ridiculous embarrassing phrases that would bring the synchronization. There is no real blood, except that some skeletons rot in a basement pond that really looks like the bottom of a modern swimming pool. The OGRE itself just fades after being run over by the family's Jeep Cherokee. <br /> <br /> The copy of the Shriek DVD that I saw was broken, and the picture went black for a few seconds, about half an hour after the movie, a mistake that I hope Shriek corrected him.

In this film, the main character Hunt Stevenson (Michael Keaton) goes to Japan and convinces a Japanese car company to come to America and help his dying city of Pennsylvania. Two things come to you. First, why should a Japanese company come to America to build cars when they do that, and so good at it? Second, anyone can understand that American companies of all kinds are going to Third World countries to produce their products in ways that escape American labor costs. The film then assumes that the largest manufacturer of cars in the world would go to one of its ""top competitors"" (next to Germany) and would call a work there as unrealistic. Keaton was still in his comedy at the time. But he still gives a credible idea, because he could prove that he can go from comedy to drama in seconds, yet still does not have to embarrass, but director Ron Howard can not stop it from becoming a TV movie Anyway, they must put a happy ending to unlikely history and not endure the politics and problems of Japanese and American relations. Gung Ho has Happy Days and Laverne and Shirley the feeling, as the producers of both TV series have made the film and then have made the TV version of this film, which gives the film its light weight. The Japanese manager will love him American workers and he feels that he and other Japanese can learn from Americans. His husband No. 2, Saito, who supposedly does not like Americans so much, does not think so. I would have preferred that all Japanese characters were like Saito, as the soft fool characters who made them Japanese. That would have made the movie more interesting."

Pamela tells Emma's story to her mother and Peter, but they ...","When I saw this movie cover, I thought at first that it was made for video. The second thing that came to mind was how similar this was to another dreadful movie ""Darkness Falls,"" the story of that stupid witch who killed people in the dark. Unfortunately, Darkness Falls was pretty much the masterpiece compared to this dump, and this movie should not have been made. <br /> <br /> The film begins with a little backstory for the witch, or more like a pointless idea of ​​two young children meeting the tooth fairy in the hope that she'll give them a shiny new bike for their tooth. The opening is badly filmed and like the rest of the movie it's certainly not scary. At the present time the film is about Peter (Lochlyn Munroe). Peter rents his house, and his ex-girlfriend Darcy (Chandra West) and her daughter Cole come to stay there. Cole meets a neighbor and they talk about the tooth fairy, and how you should not lose your tooth, otherwise it comes for you. Unfortunately, seconds later it looks like the tooth fairy is stealing her bike and knocking out her tooth (how ironic). If Cole survives the tooth fairy's anger, and her mother and Peter will be able to rescue her and reignite her romance ... it's a bad movie, you could probably find out. <br /> <br /> One of the main problems with this idiotic movie is how indefinite the tooth fairy is. They say she kills you if you lose your tooth, but no. She's more like a serial killer killing indiscriminately, and if you lose your tooth, you'll definitely go. She steals a bike, so she seems to be a thief too. I said earlier that the idea for this movie was based on Darkness Falls, but where did they get the inspiration for the appearance of the Tooth Fairy? Just take a look. She looks like a burnt offering, and she used to walk around the neighborhood kidnapping children. Hmmm ... it's almost as if she's ripping off Freddy Krueger from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" movies. And that's not the worst part of this terrible mess that is the highlight. This movie could have the most ridiculous climax (not really ridiculous because I found it more disgusting than funny) that I've ever seen. Do not see that. <br /> <br /> Just a few things. Lochlyn Munroe was in Scary Movie, and Jianna Ballard was in Scary Movie 3, and they were both in this, so obviously Scary Movie Stars are forced to end their career with evil scary films. <br /> <br /> My rating: 1/2 from ****. 80 minutes R for violence."

Dana Andrews plays detective Mark Dixon, a partial grower and a partial cop, who has a reputation for being too criminal. After a case Dixon looks for suspects and answers, he gets involved much more than he wanted. <br /> <br /> Dana Andrews is terrific in his role - tough and edgy, Andrews' Dixon is ready to put everyone off track when they get on his bad side. He's the perfect anti-hero movie noir - he's not always very nice, but we're still rusting for him. Gene Tierney does a solid job in her role as she is, a sweet shoulder for Dixon. There may not be much left for Tierney's role, but she certainly goes far beyond what others might do with the role and pushes out every member of the audience with her friendly smile, her gentle manner, and her sparkling eye. The supporting cast are also not bad - Karl Malden is the most memorable, enters and gives as Lieutenant Thomas a good side presentation. Where The Sidewalk Ends is not Laura, but it's a great movie noir with great characters, stories and pictures."

The fact is that there is hardly any spoken dialogue this turn - we only hear the thoughts of the characters - is just an unconventional aspect of it. <br /> <br /> Looking for a copy of this movie I found out that the producer was dead, the lead actor was dead, he was not kept in a British television or film archive, he was never on video or DVD released, television stations around the world destroyed him after their copyright expired in the '80s. When it first appeared on television in Australia, there were no writable devices for consumers. <br /> <br /> On the second visit I could see why it was unforgettable.

The plot itself, the story and essence of the movie, is entertaining. It's the kind of story the director (Bill Paxton) was able to do so much, and in that case, he really did a lot of it. <br /> <br /> From beginning to end you expect more and more about what happens and where the movie goes, and the creativity behind this story is first-rate. I felt like this movie was done well from start to finish, and one of those rare jewels that seemed boring lulls - the action went neat, fast, and tight from one scene to the next. <br /> <br /> It shows how far people can go to do such terrible things to their loved ones and do such acts of evil in the name of the ""God"" when they are disappointed as in this case. It is also sometimes interesting in its' twists and takes on the concept of morality as a whole. <br /> <br /> Overall, this is the kind of movie that's easy to miss, but I would advise you not to do that and to watch this movie - it's well worth your time."

Everything about this movie screams of poor quality, I can not believe how such a thing will be released!

After seeing Nina, Francoise believes that she has found her kidnapped daughter Marie, but neither Toni nor Pierre believe her. Nina is unsure about what to think...","""Gespenster"" (2005) forms together with ""Yella"" (2007) and ""Jerichow"" (2008) the ghost trilogy by director Christian Petzold, undoubtedly one of the German filmmakers of the cream-de-la-crème era. <br /> <br /> Roughly speaking, ""Ghosts"" tells the story of a French woman whose daughter was abducted as a 3-year-old child while her mother turned her head for 1 minute in Berlin - and had never been seen before. Since then, her mother has been traveling on and on to Berlin, looking for girls of her own age with her time-stretched photographs. As we hear later in the film, the mother was very often convinced that she had found her daughter Marie. But this time, when she meets Nina, everything is different. <br /> <br /> The film does not bring any solutions, not even partial solutions, and so it is rather disappointing. We are also not equipped to decide whether the mother is really crazy or not, whether her biological daughter is still alive or not. The most disappointing is the end. From what we have seen in the movie, it is unreasonable for the observer to be left alone as the author leaves Nina alone. The simple departure symbolizes that nothing has changed, can be a strong dramaturgy (eg in ""Umberto D.""), but in ""ghosts"" it is postponed. <br /> <br /> Since critics I've suggested Freudian motives in this film, let me give my own try: Why do not similar people know each other, especially not those people who know another similar person? That is, from the point of view of the Aristotelian logic according to which the concept of the individual applies, a rather crazy question. The individual is such a person who does not share any of his defining qualities with others. The Aristotelian answer to my question is thus: they do not know each other because their similarity is through pure change. Anyone who is not crazy believes that. But what about the case when these similar persons have other similarities that are unlikely to change, for Scarves on the left under the ankle or a heart-shaped birthmark under the right shoulder blade? This is the metaphysical context from which this film is made, though I'm not sure if even the director has realized that. In spite of our modern, Aristotelian world, of superstition, conserved in the mythologies of people all over the world that similar people also share parts of their individuality, and this individuality is therefore not unpredictable, but rather diffuse, so that the boundaries between people open are such and similar beliefs that, despite our otherwise highly rational thinking, form a strong backbone of irrationalism - a source of the most interesting type of ghost."

3,tt0401711,0,"Paris, je t'aime is about the plurality of cinema in one mythic location: Paris, the City of Love. Twenty filmmakers have five minutes each; the audience must weave a single narrative out of twenty moments. The 20 moments are fused by transitional interstitial sequences and also via the introduction and epilogue. Each transition begins with the last shot of the previous film and ends with the first shot of the following film, extending the enchantment and the emotion of the previous segment, preparing the audience for a surprise, and providing a cohesive atmosphere. There's a reappearing mysterious character who is a witness to the Parisian life. A common theme of Paris and love fuses all.","Only a handful of the segments are involved here. A segment with a workshop supervisor from Nigeria is heartbreaking. One with Fanny Ardent & Bob Hoskins makes sense Twist by Twist until the last shot drowns things out. <br /> <br /> The problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips call Paris. The others are so scattered in theme, tone, willpower and production that you can also see ""The Years Best Commercials, 2006"". It is really everywhere. It does not develop over its term, and nothing rules the directors. No construct successfully connects the pieces ... boredom sets in. I'm at the hour, twenty minutes and Elijah Wood is in some stupidity, over - commercial, over-produced vampire Shtick. It has about as much to do with Paris as old ladies knitting in the Antarctic. Fantasy turns up, I think first in the Coen Brothers segment (Uh, thank J & E for ruining another movie) and then makes far too many appearances. The point of being in Paris is that you do not need fake crap to make your days extraordinary. Why divide it into neighborhoods when Quartier de la Madeleine is equated with vampires for a loser director? Was a genre ever over-represented as the vampire movie? Every three years we get the same lame vampire clichés. Worse yet, the change from segment to segment is pretty artless. The transitions are lost. This does not feel like it's going to be sloppy."

At the ages of 103 and 101, they told their story to Amy Hill Hearth, a white New York Times reporter who published an article about them. The overwhelming response launched a bestselling book, a Broadway play, and this film.","A wonderful movie version of the bestseller and Broadway game about the lives of Sadie and Bessie Delany, two African-American sisters, both over 100 years old, who told their story of experiencing a century of American history. Ruby Dee and Diahann Carroll perform very well as Bessie and Sadie respectively. Amy Madigan is also good as Amy Hill Hearth, the white reporter for The New York Times, whose article on the sisters launched the book. Many of the retrospective scenes and even many of today's are very powerful, if not as inspiring as in the book. This is the only real drawback associated with the fact that certain aspects of the story are not clearly illustrated, such as the mother's inter-ethnic background and why her father was so strict.

Likewise, it is rare for me to gasp through the laughter in several scenes. The love story is a bit thin on the ground, but I would say that's probably the best, because this romantic comedy has the emphasis on ""comedy,"" and in any case, it just pushes the limits of credibility a little more than I like Most rom com's do. The four scientists have provided some of the funniest moments not just in this movie, but in every movie I've seen in a long time. I hesitated for a few moments until I finally chose a ""10"" over a ""9"" as a rating, as I believe that too many people use them indiscriminately and therefore lose the maximum rating of effectiveness. I'm also a big Meg Ryan fan who helps, but this is one of the few films I've seen that I would say is in the shade. She and Tim Robbins are the main characters, but for me they play the second fiddle against the antics of the awkward intellectuals. A really laughing loud movie."

Redd Foxx always a clown of comedy, Pearl Baily a great game as his wife witty and cheeky, Norman a son with a secret not sure if he will have a future when it is out, Dennis Dugan crazy funny man. Miss Dobson hooker with a heart and little conscience. Love, lust, strange family ties This film qualifies for a comeback encore, a sitcom with a mix of events as this could and should find its way as a remake. I think finding cast would be extremely difficult, except maybe Jerry Seinfeld plays Dennis Dugan's role, this marks a couple of Seinfeld episodes that also brought me back to Norman, that keeping you in the next was impossible impossible as unfit hooker To reform girlfriend and infidelity of a parent. This movie was a wild ride by a taxi driver, remember episode Kramer takes advice from his caddy about his lawyer.

He plans to leave the young girl in the care of Grey and take off.... but Curly Sue has other ideas!","I totally disagree with ""ctomvelu"" regarding Jim Belushi's talent. I really like Belushi. Admittedly, I was skeptical when he appeared on stage for the first time because I was such a big fan of his deceased brother John. But Jim has a screen charm that has taken him a long way - and he's done well over the years. <br /> <br /> Curly Sue is one of his earlier films - his weight is a giveaway (is not that true for most of us?) - and I like the movie. Yes, it's touching and heartwarming, so if you're into car hunts, explosions and groundless sex, then you might want to pass this on here - it's a warm movie of three lost soles that find each other. Do not get me wrong, I'm all in favor of the three above keys to a successful movie, but I also like a nice, solid story like this. <br /> <br /> And although Belushi and Kelly Lynch deliver outstanding performances, the real star of this movie is Alisan Porter - who is absolutely adorable. <br /> <br /> I do not know what happened to her career, but who is responsible for dropping the ball (Agent? Parents? Himself?) should be shot. You could not ask for a more perfect introduction to fame than this movie, and yet you have not heard from her since. <br /> <br /> Another sad Hollywood story ..."

Will any of them make it back to civilization?","I expected a bad movie and got a bad movie. But in my worst imagination, I could not imagine how bad this movie was. I do not even want to try to explain what Blood Surf is about. It's not about bloodsurfing, but about a big crocodile. They complain about the wrong shark in Jaws, but Spielberg was wise and did not show the shark until the end. The crocodile is often shown here, and it's the worst fake crocodile I've ever seen, and they're not trying to hide it. If you want to see a good fake crocodile, watch Lake Placid. <br /> <br /> The director had the opportunity to make a decent surf / shark movie, but he had to make a bad B-Monster movie. He had the chance to make an original surf movie, but he wanted to make a monster movie. So you understood how bad this movie is, does it have some good parts? Not really, it has some nudity and a sex scene that comes directly from a Playboy movie. Acting is not bad either, and Kate Fischer looks good. Too bad that she does not take off her top. The main actors are not bad either. They had some potential. The location was beautiful and the movie started with some nice surfing scenes. The blame lies with the untalented writer and director. The dialogue is one of the worst I've ever seen, and the script is really poorly written, and the director has no talent, whatever, and not much imagination. <br /> <br /> Do not look at it. Even if you want to see the beautiful Kate Fischer. It is not worth it. Watch sirens to see Kate naked, and watch Lake Placid for good crocodile action. <br /> <br /> 3/10 because I'm in a good mood, and Maureen Larrazabal looks good, and Kate looks good (but is a bad actress), and Dex Miller, Joel West and Matt Borlenghi do a good job made with the part of which they had to work."

The photo is not too good, the music is so wrong, it made me angry, the actors do not even try it, although the script makes it almost impossible to expect more from people who have been trading for 30 years and the so-called Action scenes actually manage to miss the action itself. <br /> <br /> I do not understand why these types of bad movies are coming, who is funding this shit? Where is the screening? And why on earth do actors take this mission impossible script? <br /> <br /> There are a million Hollywood movies in this genre without even striving to reach the theaters, but even they Straight To Video things actually manages to see it professional compared. <br /> <br /> I can not say anything positive except the title that explains everything, I feel robbed 2 hours of my life."

I have seen it several times in different places and always found it dark, bizarre and fascinating. I was young then, in my early teens; and years later, after I discovered the great Arliss Howard and was blown away by ""Big Bad Love,"" I bought the ""Wild Napalm"" DVD and saw her with my girlfriend for the first time in many years. I totally loved it! I was very impressed and influenced by it. There are so many dynamic fluid complexities and wisdom within camera movements and cinematography; All this fits in perfectly with the intelligent, intense and immediate chemistry between the three leads, their story, the music and all the other actors. It's really ""cinematic"". I love Arliss Howard's subtle intensity, ambivalent strength and hidden intelligence, I'm a big fan of everything he does; and his interaction with Debra Winger's manic joy (they are, of course, married) has this magical-looking reality that passes by the camera. (I wonder if they see it on wedding days? ... ""Big Bad Love"" should be the next stop for anyone who has not seen it, it's brilliant.) And Dennis Quaid in full clown make-up, sneakily introduced, angled, hidden and displayed by the shot selection, and the full flower abundance is of the kind of pure dark film magic that you do not often see. Quaid has always had an eerie quality for me, with that huge cleft of the mouth hiding behind his flickering eyes that are waiting to be unleashed as mischievous charm or devilish craziness (here as both). Both Howard and Quaid have the insane fire behind their eyes to peel off their wonderful intense internal turret squares in a dark cool way. In fact, the whole movie has a dark cool energy and hip intensity. It's really a fantastic movie put together by everyone involved in intelligence, imagination, agility and chemistry. I really can not imagine how this was funded, and it looks pretty expensive to me, through such a conventional, unimaginative system, but I thank God that movies like these are constantly slipping through the system. By and large, with all of its bright carnival colors, hipper intelligence, darkly warped, true humor, and gripping chemistry, it reminds me of one of my favorite movies of all time: ""Big Pointe Blank"" ...... That's a compliment in my book!"

Charlton Heston, ""Midway"", 76, had past experiences with James Coburn (Zach Provo), ""Deadfall"", 93, and Zach never forgave Sam and would stop at nothing to make sure he was caught up with him and paid him back.

Gilliam (allegedly) produced a long list (think of the Fifth Element plane) and gave it to Butch Bruce. It was titled ""Things Bruce Willis Does When He Trades."" It ended with a simple message saying ""Please do not do anything of the above in my movie"". <br /> <br /> There is a fact about this movie (definitely true). Gilliam had no handwriting. <br /> <br /> I argue that these two factors have played a major role in creating the extraordinary (if not commercial) success of the Twelve Monkeys. <br /> <br /> Visually, the Twelve Monkeys are all we can expect from a Gilliam movie. It is also full of Gilliamesque surrealism and general (but splendid) strangeness. Gilliam is pleased to have wronged his viewers. Although the end of the Twelve Monkeys will not surprise anyone who has been through for the first time, in the bureaucratic, ruthless movement of the characters, Gilliam hardly lends herself to her fate by Kafka. It is this journey, and the character developments that they experience, are troubling. <br /> <br /> I love Gilliam films (especially Brazil). But they all tend to suffer from the same weakness. He seems to have so many ideas and enthusiasm that almost without exception his films end up as a jumble (especially in Brazil). I still say that Brazil is Gilliam's tour de force, but there is no denying that The Twelve Monkey's brings fresh wind to the dense section. Style, substance and form seem to merge in a way that is not normally seen by ex-Python. <br /> <br /> Whatever the truth of the rumor, Gilliam also manages to achieve a first-rate (and very atypical) balding performance. Bruce is excellent in this movie, as are all the other actors, especially Brad Pitt, a fitting but also very scary guy. <br /> <br /> It's been over a decade since this movie was released. When I looked at it again, I realized that it had not really aged. Of course I had changed. And that made me watch the movie with fresh eyes. That seems to me to be an appropriate homage to a film that is at least partially about reflections, changed perspectives and the absurd one-way street of the time we all do.

All I can say to describe this worthless movie is 'TRASH'. Acting is so bad. I've seen kids do a better job at school. The whole cast seems to read only its lines, no emotion, no emotions and no space to grasp the viewer. On another note, the special effects were insanely cheesy and the whole thing looked like it was shot with a camera, anyone can buy a radio cabin. <br /> <br /> The clown himself does not look like the one on the video cover. Damn, he does not even get in the movie until just before the end and all he does is humming songs and walking around stalking some characters. It is also shown no real murder, so this is not a real Slasherfilm. Since I saw it, I've questioned a few things. 1. If 'Serial Insane Clown Killer' would not be a serial killer killing clowns? 2. If your friend is missing, why would you go to the forest to have sex instead of looking for her? Sorry, really. <br /> <br /> 3. Why did the only REAL action suddenly spit out in vain in the end? Has the cast finally decided to show up in their jobs? This movie is as sad as they come. I advise you not to rent it, so you do not waste an hour or two of your time laughing more than shouting."
4,tt0316886,0,"Boris Zaroff is a modern businessman who is haunted by his past -- his father was the notorious Count Zaroff of The Most Dangerous Game fame. Consequently, Boris is subject to hallucinations and all-too-real social lapses which normally involve sadistic harm to beautiful naked young women. His butler is sworn to indoctrinating him into the evils of the family line, and their castle's torture dungeon proves quite useful in this regard. However, Boris is periodically lured away from his destiny by the romantic apparition of the deceased countess who previously owned the castle.","You just have to open scenes like ""Seven Women for Satan""? At the intro, a naked girl runs through the forest, chased by a hunting dog and a vicious-looking guy on a horse, until she falls off a cliff and splits her head on a rock. Then the camera zooms on the guy's face and we notice him just sitting behind a desk while his secretary waits for him to sign some papers. ""Oh, I'm sorry, I was lost in my thoughts ??"" he says then! Sweet, I came across another completely crazy movie. Even if you understand only a minimum of French and look at the original title, you know immediately that ""Seven Wives for Satan"" has nothing to do with Satan or ritual sacrifice, but simply count on the extravagant escapades of a pervert and mentally unstable during his weekend in the country. This is indeed another seedy twist on the classic milestone ""The Most Dangerous Game"" about a madman's disturbing hobby of chasing people? preferably hot naked chicks - in the woods for sports. Actually, this is more than just a variation of the classic from 1932, as the author / director and actor Michel Lemoine had the claim to connect his protagonist directly to the legendary villain of Leslie Banks in ""The Most Dangerous Game"". Count Zaroff was said to have been the son of the original Earl Zaroff, but he traded his private island for the remote French countryside. He can no longer afford to be unemployed, so he's an office worker from Monday to Friday and an insane killer at the weekend. Zaroff is a real spinner, hallucinating dancing with deceased women, but actually driving her car over the living. His butler once promised to stop the Zaroffs from killing, but he's obviously doing a lousy job. There is no depth in the script and the setup certainly does not take into account any tension or weird atmosphere. Really, the only useful thing to do in this film is the girls being lured into Zaroff's fallacy and hoping they'll quickly reach seven. Half of the film is senseless and boring footage, like the excessively erotic dance act in which a statue inexplicably transforms into a muscular black man, and the other half is psychedelic slime that eventually becomes boring. All the girls look gorgeous , I have the impression that it was Michel Lemoine's intention to imitate his buddy Jean Rollin and make a delicious kinky sex thriller. ""Seven Women for Satan"" is a French production, so Jess Franco regularly plays Howard Vernon (""The Awful Dr. Orloff"", ""Zombie Lake""). Lemoine herself certainly has the look of a crazy killer, but not the talent to portray one."

Not long thereafter, the Baron transforms into a demon, and the beautiful young woman becomes his very own love slave.","I bought the BLOOD CASTLE DVD on eBay for a few dollars without knowing what it was, and all I can say is that I was not disappointed with this purchase. BLOOD CASTLE is one of those trashy European horror movies that have almost no redeeming quality, except that they are entertaining for all the bad reasons. The opening alone was worth the price of the DVD: Our heroine, Dr. Ing. Ivanna arrives at the castle to help a scientist, Baron Dalmar, experiment with dead tissue. On her way to the castle 1) a man tries to rape Ivanna. 2) The housekeeper of the castle fights with her. 3) The maid wants to see her dead. 4) and finally Baron Dalmar almost spits on her and wants her out the next day. Hmm ... something tells me that she is not welcome. With such a miserable arrival, you'd think Ivanna would leave the place in a NY-minute, but no, like so many great trashy movies, our ""wayward"" heroine decides to stay with us and even enjoys a candlelit Dinner with the grumpy baron same eventful day. The intro is so overly trashy (it's even bigger than the memorable first minutes of this Canadian movie, JUNIOR) that I knew I would enjoy that. <br /> <br /> But the fun does not end there. Ivanna is repeatedly stunned when she goes to bed in the evening to be naked, tied up and tortured by an invisible man in a light session. Even after experiencing these nocturnal S & M sessions, Ivanna remains in the castle, fully convinced of the angry Baron, that what she experiences is nothing but dreams. It is to be expected that Ivanna, even after being treated so poorly from the beginning, falls in love with the Baron. Ivanna completely ignores everything negative about him, including the obvious fact that the grumpy baron is popular with the young ladies. Every woman in the castle (it seems like only women work there) is in love with the miserable jerk who does not mind using the pretty young things. Things get even more silly when someone lurks around the property killing (and killing) women. Basically, the Baron's physically disfigured brother, Igor, is responsible for everything. In a very lengthy scene, the brother warns the baron that he should not concern himself too much with Ivanna, otherwise he will suffer the consequences. What are Baron and Ivanna doing with it? Well, they marry, of course! During the short wedding ceremony, the baron is shot dead by one of the angry natives (father of one of the dead girls). But all this does not stop Ivanna, who, amidst all the dead young ladies and the torture that surrounds them, comforts the wounded baron cheerfully: ""It's just a flesh wound"" and they can go on and enjoy their honeymoon in the castle where the killer / rapist / torturer brother is. The whole thing quickly develops into a nightmarish love triangle between Ivana, the Baron and Igor. Do everything for love! Anyway, you get the idea: it's not subtle. Almost everything is overly ridiculous in this movie and if it's not OTT, like the foreseeable climax, things get a bit boring. But for the greater part of the film, the director or author indulges in one illogical, trashy moment after another. I really love these types of films, being as slippery as a sledgehammer and being populated by characters who are illogical. Even those who created the Retromedia DVD recognize this, and when you go to the scene selection, we hear one of the funniest parts of the dialogue from the dubbed movie, which is endlessly looped. <br /> <br /> The production values ​​are beautiful. The opening and closing credits, with these candles and red curtains ... oh, a soup of the class. The music sometimes sounds like something from a Tim Burton movie, which only adds to the inconsistency of everything. And when these young women take off their clothes, they are just begging to be killed. <br /> <br /> As a standard movie, I rate that as 2, but as ""it's so bad, it's good"" movie, I rate it as solid 8 stars. If you enjoy trashy movies, please look at them. You must have seen something like that. The only thing I could think about: What would that woman need to get out of this damned castle?"

It was really a pleasant surprise. The story refers to the bisexual writer Gerard (Jeroen Krabbe), who is lured into a relationship with the beautiful hairdresser Christine (Renée Soutendijk), but in the twisted thoughts of Gerard could be more part of the story. Verhoeven and cinematographer Jan De Bont create a beautiful and dense atmosphere full of surreal and disgusting sexual imagery that really draws you into the story, you do not want to watch, but you can not turn away. This is by far the best film by Verhoeven (maybe just Robocop). True The Fourth Man is not for everyone, some of the sex scenes are completely superfluous (just ignore them, but trust me, if you watch for at least ten minutes, you'll be addicted.) This is one of those movies you need to know how it ends, a true thriller in the Hitchcock tradition, captivating, controversial and exciting, I even like the spider metaphor. <br /> <br /> 8/10"

James Steart leads an all-star cast in the scenic northwest, which is filmed in great splendor. The scenery and the costumes are great. There are action and adventure. Stewart plays a wealthy rancher who conflicts with a crooked government in the old northwest coast. <br /> <br /> The main drawback is the stereotypical cynic that Hollywood has always turned into a hero. Even as this movie was filmed, the cynic was the stereotyped hero, and the one portrayed by Stewart really has few engaging graces. He is friendly to his two partners, and that gives him an extra dimension of credibility and sympathy. <br /> <br /> However, he is so humid for all the others, it's hard to really care about him, accept him. He is very similar to the one-dimensional spaghetti western characters (cut not so bad). <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the secondary characters are quite enjoyable. Walter Brennan, Royal Dano, Harry Morgan and others make it worth seeing."

The over the remote control has made no sense at all. For a bad reason it had the best condition in the group. <br /> <br /> I'm all in favor of supporting low budget films and giving new filmmakers a fair chance, but this turkey is a waste of time and an insult to the observer. I just saw it because of some good comments posted here. They must have been planted by people associated with the film. You may make people observe this, but you can not make them like what they saw. <br /> <br /> I gave him a 2 instead of a 1 because at least the boxer story was heartwarming.

When she hears of her cousin Talia's suicide, she rushes back to Israel. They were best of friends and twin spirits. Talia saw for both of them, and was always the one who believed and led Ya'ara to believe, that in spite of her blindness, Ya'ara could see everything. Ya'ara joins Talia's family for the traditional 7-day mourning period ""The Shiv'a"" and there, she discovers the secrets of Talia's life and embarks on an investigation trying to discover the reason that led Talia to commit suicide. Lies, secrets and gaps are revealed in this powerful story","Although there is melodrama in the middle or at the bottom of the film, the story is beautifully and subtly narrated, and the acting is superb. <br /> <br /> Yaara, who studies in Princeton, returns to Israel for her life. Funeral of her oldest and dearest friend, Talia. Because Yaara practically lived with her friend's parents after the death of her own mother, she lost her adoptive sister. And because Yaara, blinded by birth, was led and guarded by Talia, her friend's suicide is as unbearable as it is inexplicable. Inevitably, the blind girl is the one who determines to solve the mystery of this death. Although she has no view, she has insight. Although she can not see, she is able to find what is out of sight, as the ""normal"" people around her. The film becomes an intriguing mystery as Yaara seeks to recall her relationship with Talia, her adoptive family home, tapes, diaries, and Talia's past and present. <br /> <br /> Told by Yara's perspective, the film is also viewed from her point of view as she imagines what she hears, believes and imagines. The mystery solution is more conventional, but the search is performed with such subtle care, and the response is rendered so beautifully and without fanfare that the pat moment is easily forgiven. The truths are gradually coming to an abrupt end, illustrating not only Talia's life, but also her relationship with Yaara. Tali Sharon, as Yaara, uses her mobile face and voice effectively and is completely believable both as an adult and as a teenager. We fully accept their ability to find their place in the world more securely at the end of the film. Noteworthy is the precision with which places and actions are repeated with small but significant variations that never get boring, the dead - through the minor characters and the interesting decision to portray Talia as a teenager. I'll argue with Yaara's final statement standing with Gadi, Talia's last boyfriend, on the edge of a cliff, but this trip to the edge is so intriguing that the picture stays in sight longer than her words are recalled."

I wander, if Ilya did not do it better, just leave her out ... As for the one leftover character, nothing is done to her. She's just visiting a goddamn place and suddenly the movie is not about her anymore but about geriatric witches spending their days making dolls out of bread, drinking homemade vodka and flashing each other.

Now that I've read the books, I understand what the story is all about. However, some of the characters are pretty silly (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, much like Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One, (AWFUL!)), But I have to say that he follows the book fairly closely, and it goes into part from Book Two, The Two Towers. The good things are that the plot is a bit interesting and some of the animations are quite remarkable for the time being. The bad part is that it ends halfway between the Two Towers, without Frodo trying to destroy the one ring, and the animation looks pretty outdated compared to today's standards. <br /> <br /> Overall, not as bad as many say. BUT, the live action version of 2001 is the new trademark of The Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson said that the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn made him create one of the greatest fantasy series of all time, so at least we can thank Ralph Bakshi for that! I will take the animated version of Lord of the Rings on the live version of Harry Potter! <br /> <br /> A 7 on a scale of 1-10, far less violent than the live version of 2001, but NEVER close so good!

I wish I had set something aside, then there is a magic wall cabinet so I can taste these things today. This magical locker may even have adapted the stuff of food to take into account how I physically and otherwise drove some sort of dynamic chemistry of anticipation. Over the course of half a century, they would have had to adapt quite a bit, because they would have known that I had set them aside. To eat now would be a celebration of self and past, and history and meaning that would make the intervening years almost an expected reward. <br /> <br /> I did not have enough sense to do that with original Coke. And I would not have invented one of those magical psychic lockers. not then. But I did something almost as good. In the seventies I really understood Roman Polanski. He was a strange and exotic pleasure ?? You know, films smuggled out of the Soviet bloc. Films that are so sensitive to beauty that you cry for weeks. Films that make you live with Polish women and then decide that they are the last ones to get it. <br /> <br /> I did the following. I took what I knew was my favorite Polanski movie and set it aside. I did not see it. I postponed until I thought I was big enough to earn it. Over the years, I would test myself, my ability to surround and describe beauty without occupying it. There are probably only a few Poles who have worked to earn Chopin. Working to earn femininity when I see it. Try to get the inners off the edges. <br /> <br /> Lately, I've got the certainty that it was time to get this out. I already knew that I was out of time, as that would work optimally, because I had already seen and understood ""9th Gate"". <br /> <br /> If you do not know this, it is a man who is innocent rents a room in which the previous tenant (of whom the story is called) jumped out of the window to die later after visiting this man (played by Polanski). What happens is that time is folding and he becomes this woman. We are tempted to believe that he is just crazy. But as we follow him, he is not. He has only lightning that the world is normal, and that the people around him are not part of a devil who is twisting his reality. <br /> <br /> The story hardly matters. What counts is how Polanksi shapes this thing, both in the way he inhabits the eye, which only makes edges, and in the body, which consists only of tangled flesh. The two never meet. There is a dissonance that can haunt me for the next 30 years. It is the idea about and inside and an outside without edges at all? at all except a red-haired wig. <br /> <br /> I do not know anyone who could do that, this sketch that remains a sketch, that horror that remains natural. <br /> <br /> To understand the geniuses of this, you must know one of the greatest movies ever made; ""Rear window."" The genius of this film is the post-noir idea that the camera shapes the world; that the viewer creates the story. What makes Roman is to take this movie and turn it upside down. In Rear Window, the idea that the on-screen viewer (Jimmy Stewart) was the anchor and everything else was a fiction woven as we watched. Here is the movie dweller the filmmaker. We know that. We know that everything we see is true because he is the narrator. We know that it is true that bodies change identity, that times shift, that causality is plastic. We know that the narrator will kill us. We know that the narrator will leave us in an eternal terror, on the border he subordinates, but never shows us and introduces us. <br /> <br /> Teds rating - 4 of 3: Every Cineliter should know this."

In fact, Allen is reviewing Manhattan Murder Mystery and Purple Rose of Cairo, to name just a few other examples. I do not care if he reworks; I would like the new material to be at least equal to the originals, and unfortunately it only reflects its younger size. <br /> <br /> Allen as a director and actor can not hide his love for the actress, as he could not for Diane Keaton, and therefore takes a mediocre comedy to an appropriate location in the Allen canon, not big but amusing , sometimes brilliantly satirical: About the alleged upper-class murderer Sid (Allen) jokes ""I would be very surprised if he had killed a person.""

To make matters worse, the ""Hommage's"" (typical of a director trying to fulfill his obligations to former masters) is either absolutely cliched or unconvincing.

Maybe it has to be ""your kind of thing,"" but I saw it with my sister and mother, and we were all taken with it. <br /> <br /> Acting was also very good, and that's hard to do in a movie like this one. But I found all characters very fascinating and sympathetic. <br /> <br /> I've always loved Dougray Scott and found his new ""dark"" role very interesting. It's really hard to make me look like a bad guy, but I had absolutely no problem with it. What's more, I loved him. <br /> <br /> If you love a good thriller / drama that also has a good dose of love and tragedy, you should definitely watch this movie, no question! If you want to watch a movie with 80% bloodshed, you should rent something else. But I think the title is there again. This is a love story, not Saw 3. <br /> <br /> I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars !!! Good work !!! <br /> <br /> xxx Have fun!"

Without this limited knowledge, this film would have been a complete mystery, and even so, I am still less educated in the 1984 story than before. <br /> <br /> On the positive side. .. <br /> <br /> The cinematography is amazing, Hurt & Burton perform well and the overall feel of the movie is wonderfully grim and bleak. The prostitute scene was a fantastically dark piece of film. <br /> <br /> Now for the downside, and there are many ... <br /> <br /> There is a war going on (at least as far as the propaganda is concerned), but why and with whom? Nothing is explained. There are a few names (Eurasia, etc.), but they do not mean anything without explanation. <br /> <br /> Who is Winston? what does he do? Where does he comes from? where does he work? Why does he change messages? Why is not he on the front line? Why does not he eat the food in the canteen? What is the drink he drinks throughout the movie? Why is he so weak and sick? Why is not he brainwashed like everyone else? What's the deal with his mother and sister? What happened to his father? A little backstory would have been nice, no scrub, important for those like me who did not read the book. Without it, this is just a confusing and hard-to-follow art-house movie that keeps you guessing what's actually going on. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack was dis-jointed and badly edited and the constant chatter of The Big Brother's screens swamped the dialogue in some places, making it even harder to figure out what's going on. I accept that this was an artistic decision, but it is still very annoying. <br /> <br /> I also know that this has been mentioned, but why all the nudity? It just seemed superfluous and it felt like it had been thrown in to make up for the lack of any plot reporting. <br /> <br /> I personally can not stand, as Hollywood believes, telling stories for word these days. We're not all brainwashing fools, but that's a few steps too far the other way. I can only imagine that it is entirely due to the fact that you have read the book, because if this film is really the ""literal translation"" that I have seen many, it would be difficult to understand why 1984 is celebrated like the classic it is. <br /> <br /> It is undeniable that it was light years ahead of time and has pretty much predicted every change in our society so far (maybe that was some kind of Bible for the forces that are?), but many science fiction novelists have done the same without leaving any gaps in the story. <br /> <br /> I think I have to do what I should have done from the beginning and buy a copy of the book if I make sense of it. <br /> <br /> All in all, very disappointed with something I have been waiting for years to see."

Nothing is being manufactured at all any more and society has broken down into primitive localized communities. In 1966 a great plague wipes out most of what people are left but small numbers still survive. One day a strange aircraft lands at one of these communities and its pilot tells of an organization which is rebuilding civilization and slowly moving across the world re-civilizing these groups of survivors. Great reconstruction takes place over the next few decades and society is once again great and strong. The world's population is now living in underground cities. In the year 2035, on the eve of man's first flight to the moon, a popular uprising against progress (which some people claim has caused the wars of the past) gains support and becomes violent.","If scientists behaved in such a way that H. G. Wells was confident that this would be the case in the future, the story would not have gone down as it had done in ""Things To Come"". Nearly 80 years have passed since Wells wrote The Shape Of The Things To Come, on which this film is based, and closer to the world he describes than before, in some more distant directions. <br /> <br /> Although well-known players like Raymond Massey, Ralph Richardson and Cedric Hardwicke are in the cast, they are more caricatures than real characters. It is the main weakness of the film, it is dedicated to Wells' philosophy of science, solves all the problems and the rest of us are backward fools. <br /> <br /> Massey's characters, two generations of the same family, hold this extremely optimistic view. Cedric Hardwicke is a skeptic who feels that man is too far ahead. And Ralph Richardson is a warlord born of the destruction of another Thirty Years War fought with modern weapons. Incidentally, since the atomic bomb was not invented, poison gas was considered a weapon that almost destroys humanity. <br /> <br /> According to Wells, science and conquest can never mix. Scientists as a group are way too far beyond the world of politics to engage in such things. During Wells's lifetime, the scientists fled from the far-right governments of Hitler and Mussolini. The same people, however, to defeat them, submitted to the Allies and formed the nuclear weapons that introduced the modern age. If they acted the way Wells would have liked, someone like Albert Einstein would have led a junta of scientists who would have created a new order after the Second World War. <br /> <br /> Wells misunderstood it both in time and in development. He apparently never imagined the computer as well as nuclear power. Computer programmers are more likely to be our rulers in a brave new world than scientists at the moment. Still Things To Come, supported by the director William Cameron Menzies and the resulting sets offer an interesting insight into the mind of H. G. Wells, certainly a respected thinker of his time, although he did not quite get the shape of Things To Come."

Opponents of this opinion could argue that this title should not be judged on the same criteria as others, since it is an independent, low-budget movie, but come on? the dilettantism and the meager innovations are frightening. <br /> <br /> I agree with everything that has been said about this movie, for example the mind numbing weak acting (if it's that bad, you take another try to turn the scene, damn it), The thing I found most annoying was the total lack of common sense in the script, provided that such a thing existed during production. There was an obvious absence of dialogue with respect for the viewers, the girls changed their personality several times and they did not seem to sing any rationality or even brains - five relatively fitting girls against a light female psychopath. Tail them, why do not you? <br /> <br /> The only thing that can be considered as a kind of conquest for this title is that the camera never leaves the van and thus the viewer sees everything in it - which, like the rest of the movie A good idea is done exponentially terribly.

I just wanted to watch this movie for a long time because of the poster. Does not Charlotte Gainsbourg look very sexy and smile like that? I am in love with this woman! I got what I expected ... but only half. This film should have expectations for those who enjoy all kinds of romantic comedies or stories with intelligent humor and light dramatic situations. <br /> <br /> I do not agree with another fellow IMDb user who says the movie is overrated; I must admit that ""Préte-moi ta main"" has many mistakes. <br /> <br /> My main problem with the movie is the lack of screen chemistry between the main characters. There is not a single scene before the climax that shows that the main characters share a moment of ""romance"" or even an indication that they are interested in each other. <br /> <br /> In fact, only scene was both share a moment is tremendously embarrassing (if both are on the couch), and does not help understand the audience, a potential love interest. I did not buy the dinner sequence. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the film delivers very funny moments and has strong dialogues that support such a naive premise. I mean naively, that these days it would be very hard to carry out such a farse from a 43-year-old man. <br /> <br /> I understand that it's a movie and that's why I accept it as a funny situation. Plus, the humor is versatile. There are moments with S & M, funny lines with Chabat's best friend, some lesbian references, funny situations with the family women and more. <br /> <br /> Charlotte Gaionbourg's performance is first class and she is by far the reason to watch the movie. She's funny, sexy, looks very thin and good and shows that it is a versatile and talented actress who can produce a comedic and dramatic performance in sheer brilliance. <br /> <br /> Alain Chabat is a good actor and gives a very good decent performance. I think the supporting actors do what they can. <br /> <br /> The score, art direction and other technical aspects are really good and give the movie a dynamic look. <br /> <br /> Who enjoy this kind of cinema should be pleased after the credits. It's a good example of a good movie."

""October Sky"" feels and looks so familiar. And it is. All the storylines and emotions have been researched before in other films - and possibly even better. But despite his familiarity and resistance to all Hollywood formulas, this film is winning and sympathetic at every turn. <br /> <br /> Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of heart, mind and soul.

While the truncated townspeople of the 1950s coal city reject the event, Homer sees Hickham as his ticket to life in the mines. <br /> <br /> Masterly instructions and castings make the journey of rocket boys Homer and his buddies appear fresh and new. Particularly affected are subplots in relation to Homer's ailing young school teacher. Remarkable restraint is shown in the presentation of her delicate relationship. Also noteworthy is the father / son supplement that anchors the film. Played perfectly around. Even Homer's mother gets her moment without cliché or intrusion. Her ultimatum to her husband is both dignified and heartbreaking. ""Myrtle Beach"" says it all. <br /> <br /> A big video chain I despise has a sign next to this movie saying that you will love this movie or that you will refund your money.

And there neither the Real Ghostbusters nor the Flintstone Kids I was very promising for myself, I ""retired"" and fell asleep on Saturday morning. I only returned in 1988 for Saturday and Saturday only for a single animated show. <br /> <br /> A new animated Superman show was something I would not miss. I was 17 at the time and in high school, but what's up? I loved this show. As far as I can remember, this series was a gift to the fans that I accepted on the occasion of Superman's 50th birthday this year. The theme music and style reminded of John Williams film music from the Superman films Richard Donner / Christopher Reeve. I really felt that Ruby Spears' animation style was reminiscent of the Super Powers Team: Galactic Guardians series by Hanna Barbera a few years ago. Unfortunately, Danny Dark did not return as Superman, but I felt that Beau Weaver did a very impressive job as the voice of Superman and his Clark Kent was nerdig like the Chris Reeve version. After his hearing as Reed Richards / Mr. Fantastic in the 90s Fantastic Four, I still could see this version of Superman in my mind. Ginny McSwain as Lois Lane. LOL! What a rhyme she was a dubbing director for Hanna Barbera and Ruby Spears, and I think she's committed to making Lois. Memories of the super friends remained in this series when it came to the voice over cast. Jimmy Olsen is Mark Taylor, who was on the SuperFriends formerly Firestorm. Perry White is none other than former Batman TV author Stanley Ralph Ross, who was on SuperFriends Gorilla Grodd and Brainiac in the Super Powers shows. And Lex Luthor, now a wise billionaire, is none other than SuperFriend's voice alum Michael Bell, whom I know best as Zan and the Riddler as well as many other characters from many other series. <br /> <br /> I felt that this series was a combination of the movie Superman and John Byrne in Superman's postwar concept, living with Lex Luthor as a billionaire tycoon, Jonathan and Martha Kent, to Clark as Superman to see. The Bruce Timm series and Lois and Clark would do the same. Unfortunately we have never seen Brainiac, Bizarro, Toyman, Metallo or Darkseid. Except Luthor, we only saw the Prankster and saw General Zod. I especially liked this episode with Wonder Woman, voiced by BJ Ward, who also played her on the Super Powers team. <br /> <br /> The episodes were overwhelming, and I also enjoyed Clark's growth and development stories from childhood through childhood to adolescent adulthood. <br /> <br /> The only two things I did not like. It only lasted one season. And after Wonder Way's guest spot, I hoped that Batman would be voiced by Adam West (I still remember the Super Powers Team episodes). I also hoped that the Prankster episode saw baseball team Metropolis take on Gotham Goliaths. <br /> <br /> Every popular superhero has a very rare comic series. For SpiderMan, I think it was the 1981 solo series that aired at the same time as Amazing Friends. For the Incredible Hulk it's the 1982 cartoon. For the Fantastic Four it's the 1978 series with HERBIE the Robot. For Batman it is the New Adventures of Batman 1977 by Filmation with BatMite. But for Superman this is the rarest series. <br /> <br /> Superman books and documentaries never treat or mention them. This is another series that WB should consider for DVD release. All in all, this 1988 version of Superman is good .... Great !!"

I even liked Baker in ""Mitchell"" because he played an anti-hero who was considered unlikely. Yes, MST3K's coverage was hilarious, but they made a lot of cheap recordings on Baker that he did not deserve to keep things alive and entertaining of the movie. <br /> <br /> ""Final Justice"" seems more like the same, but despite the exotic locations and the theme of ""Cowboy Frontier Justice,"" it's a bit weaker than ""Mitchell."" , And the main reason is that Baker's character, as written, is an idiot. The film has the notion that Baker, as Baker embodies Old Frontier Machismo, challenges its opponents to old-style Mano-a-Mano quick-draw contests. And because he is so tough and macho, he always wins, even if he is injured, wounded, inferior, and so on. <br /> <br /> This is a fantasy with a lot of potential (it has worked for Gary Cooper), even if it is so condemns the movie to status ""B"". But Baker is so damn stupid and obsessed that he unnecessarily challenges three of the evil man's stooges to a showdown in a public market, with civilians everywhere. He just MAY have locked her up to the chief's headquarters (which is why he was following her at all) and they would never have noticed. Or he might have gotten the drop on her and forced her to surrender, and got one of the followers to take him to the top of the gun. But no, he has to be a Busch league hot dog and a macho fool, so he gets a kid taken hostage in the shootout! <br /> <br /> This is a guy we should admire? <br /> <br /> The whole movie is basically like this. Most of the supporting actors are somewhere between OK (the followers) and pretty good (the boss villain and his father, two well-known European actors) - they just go through the motions, but they are professionals and make it hard for them to be decent) , But through all of this, Baker's character draws stupid, unproductive stunts and mistakes that kill at least two relatively innocent people, plus a few baddies that may have been kept alive without the use of lethal force. > On a positive note, 90% of the film plays in Malta or the Mediterranean. Here you can see many beautiful landscapes and many exotic extras. And really, Baker himself is on the downside and a bit dyspeptic, but he's not that bad ... certainly not the weapon that these critics (including Mike and the bots in their hilarious coverage) seem to think. <br /> <br /> In short, this movie is good for video wallpapers, but the viewer should not bother with it."

They use all the elements of the classic film ""How we hit the skids"", take the bonds of ""A Beautiful Mind"" very generously, take the fake ""feel good"" attitude of films like ""Rocky"" - you choose the sequence number - and whip up a lot of melodrama in the style of the 1930s All that's left on the screen is a burnt-out cover of a movie. It is trite, banal, absolutely predictable and too often plays on our feelings. I hate to say it, but this is the kind of movie that, when you say you hated it, people will make you look bad. I really wish I could say something positive about this movie, but I really can not. Acting triggers it a bit, but not enough to give more than one star. Strictly made for TV movie material.

7,tt0117093,1,"Howard W. Campbell, Jr., an American expatriate playwright, Nazi radio propagandist, and Allied spy, writes his memoirs during his pre-trial confinement in 1961 Haifa and learns that people are what they pretend to be.","I'm a big fan of Vonnegut's work and I love this movie a lot, but I would not say that this is a Mother Night movie I'm reading. When people say that Vonnegut is not able to film, I can think of two things. One is that many of his subjects are very close to the ankle or even taboo, despite the allegations sometimes made against him that he chooses relatively ""easy"" goals for his satire. This means less every day that goes by in terms of filmability. Directors seem to enjoy breaking taboos these days, and I have high hopes for the version of ""Bluebeard"" that is now in production. It's amazing to think that an innocent piece like Vonnegut's ""Sirens of Titan"" would probably have been the equivalent of ""R"" when it was filmed when it was released in the 1950s because of its violence, language and sexuality and thematic content, though it's a tragedy that no one has come up with a scriptable script yet. And in the current economic climate, I also hope that a director will look closely at ""Jailbird"", ""Galapagos"" and ""Hocus Pocus"". <br /> <br /> The other thing is his narrative style, irony raises irony to irony, but still weird. It seems impossible to objectify, and that seems to be the biggest obstacle to making great films about his great novels, because the little comments that make up our reaction as readers are simply not possible in films, without too often awkward techniques Vonnegut said that the filmed versions of his work lacked a character who himself acted as author / narrator, and in his honor, ""Breakfast of Champions"" (the film) attempted to maintain the comedy, and came to grief a bit of a Cropper, just like another turkey from a Vonnegut novel ""Slapstick"" in an even more spectacular way. <br /> <br /> Still, it's not a bad thing if a director gives us his subjective interpretation of Vonnegut, and ""Mother Night"" is an excellent example of how a good director, as another reviewer put it, adds a visual poetry to such a source But so much of the humor is lost that although it is the same plot, it does not really come from the novel I've read. If that had been so, I would probably have rolled in the hallways and laughed a few times when I saw it. For a reader of the novel, I think a giggle is even forgivable in the end. However, the end of the film is really poignant, and I think one of the film's successes is that you really can feel someone has seen someone between razor and greed switch between good and evil, and the jury is still out. <br /> <br /> Alone and alone, a look is worthwhile. Technically, there are minor but blatant mistakes, especially in continuity, and it often looks shabby and theatrical, but mostly meets an acceptable rating and occasionally displays considerable imagination and ingenuity. The spectacle is usually of a high order, even though dialogue may be stilted a bit by today's standards. <br /> <br /> It pretty much survives when you look back to back with ""Slaughterhouse-5"" and that is indeed the case Vonnegut shot some of the ""good"" out there, mostly versions of his short stories - ""Harrison Bergeron, """" Who am I now? "" and a few other things, like the misfiring, filmed version of his very funny, but disposable, Happy Birthday Wanda June game. There was also an interesting piece, if it still exists, in the 70s, ""Between Time And Timbuktu"", which Vonnegut did not seem to appreciate, even though he was involved in his production because he felt it was him misinterpreted in its generality. He said it reminded him of the bizarre surgical experiments that were done in the story of HG Wells's The Island of Dr. Moreau, but it was an excellent introduction to his work for many people. <br /> <br /> But if the films do not let you go to the superior source material, they do not do their job. <br /> <br /> As the man said, the big show is more or less in your head."

He falls in love with her, but Emy gravely informs him that, in the ancient East Asian custom, she is betrothed to a man she has never met.","The handsome British flight pilot George Taylor (a solid portrayal of Guiseppe Pambieri) is beaten up by thugs after a wild night in Hong Kong. George meets and falls in love with the sweet and virginal Dr. Emy Wong (a fine and charming performance by the enchanting Chai Lee). George recovers and goes back to work. When Emy no longer hears about George, she succumbs to despair and becomes a prostitute. While director / co-author Bitto Albertini does indeed deliver a satisfying amount of the expected delicious nudity and steamy softcore sex, this movie is anything but a routine that devours out of sheer mess. Instead, it is a surprisingly thoughtful, touching and tragic love story between two well-drawn and very responsive characters (Chai as Emy Wong is particularly radiant and lovable). The image starts bubbly and happy, but the sound changes radically into a grimmer and tougher mood around two-thirds of the passage. Emy's descent into vice, after falsely believing that George left her, is grim and disturbing; Likewise, the remarkably sad and heartbreaking surprise ending. Granted, the narrative is certainly melodramatic, but never too stupid or trashy. In addition, the sex scenes are very tasteful and even genuinely erotic. The notorious Italian pornstar Ilona Staller has a handsome, sizeable supporting role as George's jealous and uninhibited secretary Helen Miller. Guido Mancori's sophisticated cinematography offers many exciting shots of exotic locations. Nico Fidenco's funky, pulsating score hits the groovy spot.

I saw it a second time the other day to see if I had been unfair for the first time. I turned it off after ten minutes. I can hardly believe that even a twelve-year-old boy can find that funny. The dialogue is an irritation, Myers hurts, just like Heather Graham, and the succession of characters, including Fat Bastard, makes things even worse.

This is by far the funniest thing on TV. The league consists of Jeremy Dyson, Steve Pemberton, Mark Gatiss and the beautiful Reece Shearsmith. Totally underrated is this horror comedy perfection.

The steam train on which the commandos are training shows the logo of the JZ (Jugoslavia Zeleznice or Yugoslav State Railways) on the side of the locomotive quite clearly, although the manufacturers have tried to obscure it.

The main question is ""Is anybody who is looking like a man, A REAL MAN?""","This film (and yes, it's a movie - it was shot as a two-parter, but the two parts together make up more than two hours) - is one of the unsung masterpieces of world cinema. The film is a very good-natured and at the same time absolutely cruel denunciation of the Soviet regime and the kind of person who flourished under it. He is a faithful adaptation of the long-forbidden eponymous book by Mikhail Bulgakov. The sets are immaculate, and the director has made the brilliant decision to film in monochrome sepia, and feels authentically where a washed-up color incarnation of the late '80s almost ruined the film. I will not say much about the plot it deserves to be discovered by the viewer, but the performances are real Oscar material. Special mention goes to E. Evstigneev, who plays the old professor with such presence, gravitas and kind wisdom that in the end he barely steals every scene in which he finds himself with hardly a word or a gesture. The second, of course, is Creature / Sharikov V. Tolokonnikov's frightening perfection character is far scarier than Hannibal Lecter, for it does not exist only in real life - entire countries have been ruled throughout history by men like him, with everything, what happens. <br /> <br /> Although this is a socio-political allegory, it is worth noting that the movie is also full of humor, albeit dark - there are many funny comedies that did not make me laugh like this movie. When you laugh about this movie, you not only feel funny, but also sympathetic and united, which is always a plus. <br /> <br /> There is hardly a complaint I have with this film - the only one small flaw is the tone of intellectual / bourgeois snobbery that I sometimes catch from the ""enlightened"" characters. But that is a small mistake. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately this movie seems to have been bypassed by Western licensed companies. It is a terrible shame that one of the best all-round films out there is unrestored and untranslated (which should not be incredibly hard) - although all cultural references and revolutionary terminology inevitably fade in translation, the main themes of the film should be accessible to all). While we wait with fingers for the Criterion edition, I'm thinking of creating English subtitles myself. Let's see how it works."
9,tt0118141,1,"What Is It? is a bewildering, unnerving, surreal, blackly comic film from the visionary mind of Crispin Glover that tells the inner and outer struggles of a young man facing villains and demons on multiple planes.","This movie is very interesting. I've seen it twice, and it seems Glover has hit the nail on his head with what he claims. I can point out, on the one hand, the outrage that the filmmaker is clearly expressing in the face of the current, thoughtless business that is a rush in every media center, and the things we should not think about as a culture because of corporate media control. The outrage that Glover expresses through the ""outrageous"" elements in the films is beautiful in both his visceral aggressiveness and his poetic power. I'm glad I saw this movie, and it's even clearer that Glover is up to something interesting in the second part of the trilogy. It's okay! ALL IS WELL. See also that. People who dismiss this movie as ""thoughtless"" or ""overbearing"" really miss the boat. This is a smart movie.

Apart from the combat scenes, some of the production and special effects are crude, obviously because most of the budget for this film was saved for the fight scenes.

1,tt0391104,0,"""Baptists at Our Barbecue"" is the comedic story of the small town of Longwinded, USA, a divided, feuding town of 262 Mormons and 262 Baptists. It's also a love story, about one man who will try anything to end the ridiculous feud, bring the town together, and keep the peace-loving girl of his dreams from leaving town.","""Baptists at Our Barbecue"" is the best movie ever made. Now that I have caught your attention with this dreadfully inaccurate statement that should be a hanging offense in the case of a conversation, let me start with my brief overview of this sticky, offensive, overbearing and boring scrap product. First of all, this stinker's low budget is completely obvious, based on the very bad and inexperienced direction of Christian Vuissa and the cheesy, all-preaching, winy and stilted screenplay by F. Mathew Smith. I really despise the fact that this sends out a very pro-Mormon and a kind of anti-any other religious message. Yes, the story is about a small town half full of Mormons and half full of Baptists. It shows that all the main and role model characters are Mormons and are so kind and perfect, yet they are taken up by the evil, engaging and very valuable Baptists. It shows how beautiful Mormons are and how cold-hearted and ignorant Baptists, instead of showing a little solidarity, would be appropriate and realistic. I'm not part of a religion (I'm actually an atheist), but that offended me along with a myriad of Baptists, most likely. It shows that for the Mormons, the Baptists are very unopened and unwelcoming, and that the Mormons are very acceptable, though in reality there is again a mutual dislike / dislike between them. I'm sorry, I did not want to go on a whim. <br /> <br /> Another aspect of 'Baptists at Our Barbecue' that I did not particularly care about was acting. The performances are very amateurish and unnatural, especially by the female lead Heather Beers. Miss Beers stumbles through her role with no passion or emotion for her role, and Dan Merkley, who is the main character in this lackluster movie, did not particularly impress me, but I have to say he is much more talented or shows more talent in this film than Heather Beers. Who played the sheriff of the city, was also terrible. Although there may be a tiny laugh in the movie, it's full of stereotypes. For example, the protagonist Tartan (Merkley) finds solace in a Native American woman who always gives him the best advice on how a tribe lives - how cliché is that? To make the situation even miserable, Tartan buys a puppy dog ​​to the poor, lonely pagan. Ugghhh! <br /> <br /> If you want my advice, stay as far away as possible from 'Baptists at Our Barbecue'. I saw it on the shelf and thought it was a sweet and interesting little indie about religion. All I got was a piece of crap. Note: D- <br /> <br /> my rating help - A + (absolutely flawless); A (a masterpiece, almost perfect); A- (excellent); B + (great); B (very good); B- (good); C + (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D + (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutely horrible); F (not a single quality effect in this piece of Hollywood feces)."

Is the killer their ancestor, the ""Red Queen"" whom legend says claims seven lives every hundred years?","There are some films that every horror fanatic owes himself, and Emilio Miraglias ""La Dama Rossa Uccide Sette Volte"". ""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" (1972) is definitely one of them. Since Gialli and Gothic Tales were my two favorite subgenres in horror, I was really looking forward to seeing this movie for a while, and though my expectations were high, this masterpiece exceeded my highest hopes. Miraglio's earlier Giallo, ""The Night That Evelyn Arised"" (1971), was already a scary and highly atmospheric film that successfully blended Giallo with Gothic horror, but was unlike this personal personal favorite. ""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" is undoubtedly one of the most unique and overwhelming Italian horror films ever made, and no lover of the genre could consider missing it. An incredibly fascinating giallo with strong gothic elements. ""The Red Queen"" offers everything one can expect in both genres: an imaginative and incredibly captivating storyline, creepy suspense, an eerily sinister setting and a truly eerie atmosphere colors, stylish murders, a brilliant score and last but not least a gorgeous female cast Led by breathtakingly beautiful Barbara Bouchet, this film is simply one of the most outstanding combinations of elegant beauty and sheer terror. <br /> <br /> The movie begins incredibly in a beautiful gothic castle in Germany. Kitty Wildenbrück and her sister Evelyn fought as little girls when her grandfather tells the story behind an incredibly sinister painting: Legend has it that a devilish red lady should return to the castle every hundred years and kill seven people. Fourteen years later, Kitty (Barbara Bouchet) has become a successful fashion photographer. Suddenly people are being murdered ... Director Miraglia's ""Evelyn's Night Out"" has demonstrated his incredible talent for style, atmosphere and colorful scary, and he uses these elements in this gem much more effectively. ""The Red Queen Kills Seven Times"" is indeed a feast for the eyes and one of the most overwhelming Italian horror films, both visually and in terms of plot. Only the haunting painting in the grandfather's castle can give the viewer the goose bumps. The Red Lady (or Red Queen, as she's known in the English title) is probably the meanest figure in a giallo, and the scary laughter that accompanies the murders alone would be frightening. <br /> <br /> A sexy female cast is always appreciated, especially in a giallo, and this is a prime example of it. The gorgeous Barbara Bouchet (one of my favorite actresses) has to be one of the most beautiful women ever seen on screen, and she's also a great actress. Bouchet's presence has recorded many Italian films, including playing in three of the greatest cult masterpieces of Italian cinema in the 1970s: Fernando Di Leo's ""Milano Calibro 9"", Lucio Fulci's Giallo highlight ""Don"" Tortures She is a duckling and this unforgettable jewel Apart from the wonderful Miss Bouchet, the beautiful female cast of the film includes young, sexy Sybil Danning, Marina Malfatti (""The Night Evelyn came out of the grave"") and other beauties Do not be afraid to wear it for the camera. <br /> <br /> Like the rest of the film, the murders are stylish and extremely elegant, but scary and macabre at the same time, and some of them are pretty bloody - Bruno Nicolai's captivating film music so memorable that the eerie atmosphere of the film becomes even more insistent, the plot is sophisticated and full of red herrings, the tension increases every minute. ""The Red Que en ... ""starts scary and remains breathtaking until the last second. Overall, this is one of the films for which I can not find enough praise.

Thus, the base is quite solid: British soldiers who are interned in a German camp, devise a brilliant escape plan and borrow a page of the Greek legend. Digging under a vaulting horse used in physical exertion and under full view of the kidnappers! Actually, the film is divided into two halves: the first is about the slow excavation of the tunnel to the flight itself, while the last stages represent their assets outside the camp, while trying to reach the neutral Sweden. Typical for these British films, the cast features several well-established (Leo Genn), current (Anthony Steel) and up-and-coming (Peter Finch, David Tomlinson and Bill Travers) stars, not to mention countless reliable character actors (Anthony Dawson), Bryan Forbes, Michael Goodliffe and Walter Gotell). The three tracks / escapes are Genn, Steel and Tomlinson: while the first two hold together, are the latter going their own way? Just to bump into the others when they're safe. As you might expect, the narrative contains much excitement and excitement; as with most male-centered P.O.W. Even the saying of women is kept to a minimum. Director Lee did not have a long career? with this and the somewhat similar (albeit with a change of attitude and point of view) A TOWN LIKE ALICE (1956) his most notable achievements? but in this case he certainly milked every exciting situation (even if alleged delays in filming led to Lee giving up his post prematurely and producer Ian Dalrymple having given up the task of tying loose ends!).

On the first night, Theo and Nell experience strange phenomena in the house, including unusual noises and inexplicable changes in temperature. Nell is confronted after the main hall has been vandalized with the words ""Welcome Home, Eleanor"". He is extremely disturbed and wants to prove that the house is being persecuted by the souls of the victims, who are affected by Crain's cruelty. She learns that Crain built his fortune by exploiting kidnapped children for slave labor and murdering them if they no longer benefit him. Then he burned the corpses in the fireplace of the house to hide evidence. She also learns that Crain had a second wife named Carolyn, from whom Nell descended. Everyone thinks they are crazy, while Nell is convinced she belongs here. Seriously, I suggest you stay away from this movie, it's really stupid and pointless. Not to mention the actress who played Nell, Lili Taylor completely annoyed me, her performance, her looks, all about her, does not turn me into things I would do just to keep her from seeing her again in the movie. Catherine Zeta Jones just did not fit into her role and Liam Neeson, a wonderful actor, wasted talent again. The effects are exaggerated and too computerized, I just can not believe that they would destroy a wonderful classic with this quark. Believe me, if you're afraid of something, you're scared to see how you can turn a big ghost story into an annoying piece of confused nonsense. Oh, this movie hurts, just do not see, it's bad. <br /> <br /> 1/10"

""Direct To DVD"" usually stands for cheap, incompetent filming. However, last year I was pleasantly surprised when I thoroughly enjoyed the DVD sequel ""The Naked Mile"". The filmmakers took the opportunity to deliver a slippery but funny little movie. This year they offer the successor ""Beta House"". That's the honest truth, ""Beta House"" makes the first ""American Pie"" movies look like ""The Little Mermaid"". <br /> <br /> This is not an inhibitor, tasteless, sheer fun. Sure, the story is a bit thin, but that's the beauty of the whole thing. Within the first 10 minutes we will be introduced to the main characters, the new subordinates, get a handful of crunchy gags, hit the bad guys and set the general storyline. With all this out of the way, the movie becomes a no-limit ride. The gags are plentiful and they have NOT held back in this case. I'm talking about male semen, urine, dildos, cock with tails, sex with sheep, female orgasm sprays and much more. Not to mention the fact that no minute passes without breasts or sex scene. <br /> <br /> The return of ""The Naked Mile"" comes from John White, Jake Siegel, Steve Talley and Eugene Levy (similar) supporting act as the last films). The entire cast works well. In particular, Steve Talley (Dwight Stifler) has a great deal of energy and screen presence. I predict good things for him. The film also contains great movie references for those who keep their eyes peeled. By far the biggest laugh in the movie was the parody ""The Deerhunter"" for me. Classic. <br /> <br /> The bottom line is that you feel at home with ""Beta House"". It really pushes the boundaries of good taste, but is pretty funny in the end."

Romero, the word ""zombie"" is automatically associated with blood-soaked horror images and non-stop game sequences. It is safe to say that his ""Night of the Living Dead"" shaped the zombie movie as we know it now. In the early years of cinema, however, the premise of revived corpses was only used in slow, almost actionless psychological thrillers. Jacques Tourneurs ""I've gone with a zombie"" is a perfect example, and ""White Zombie"" with Bela Lugosi. This ""uprising of the zombies"" could have been another example, but unfortunately it's a failure across the board and easily one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. Terrible spectacle, a very poorly written script and a complete lack of atmosphere and excitement! The movie lasts only 65 minutes and yet the first half hour is completely wasted on stupid love story intrigues and not exciting monologues. The setting in the legendary Cambodian city of Angkor could have led to a more compelling story, but all we ever see is interior photography. The lead actress (Dorothy Stone, textbook blond with curly hair and an ugly nose) irritated me enormously and I always hoped that an enthusiastic undead would suddenly emerge from nowhere to devour her. Bad luck again? If you manage to fight through 60 sleepless minutes, you will be rewarded with a decent final. However, this is still far too little to rate this film positively, let alone a recommendation. Avoid! You should only see this type of film if you have already seen everything else."

A friend and I attended a Canada Day concert in Barrie, and it was a who's who of the best Canadian bands of that time. We arrived at 4am, waiting in line almost all morning, and when the doors opened at 9am, we were among the first inside the gates. We then waited and waited in the hot sun, slowly grilling, but we did not care, because the headliners were among our favorites. At some point in the early afternoon, I sat down and fell asleep with my back to the barrier. A screaming girl wearing a Rheostatics T-shirt woke me to my shock and dismay. That's why I hated the rheostatics until today. Apart from her fandom, there is nothing sensible, neither taste nor certainty. Rotten of me, right? Well, in my hatred of the band, I denied the joy that Whale Music is. Desmond Howl had everything. It's hard to say what he lost as he lives in a fantastic manor house sandwiched between the sea and the mountains (the BC region where the movie was shot is breathtaking). The life that most of us dream of is dismantled by dreams, ghosts and its own past, until the day a juvenile criminal breaks in ... and, as it sounds, breaks out. Canadian cinema has several problems. In general, a lack of money and an unbearable lack of help (as if the feature was somehow no longer Canadian) lead to lower production levels than American or British films, and most people do not look or sound like an American movie , Next, Canadian screenwriters often seem so dumbfounded that they do not know how to tell a good story and tell it well. Third, they seem to think that an unaffected nudity (often quite frontal) does something artistic. I'm sure anyone who watches enough Canadian films, especially late in the CBC, knows exactly what I'm talking about. It's almost as if there's a ""do not do this"" manual out there, and Canadian filmmakers kicked it out long ago. Bruce McDonald's work and the brilliant CRAZY broke that mold and managed to do that Keeping what makes you Canadian while capturing observable production values ​​and great stories. Whale music is such a film on the surface. Deeper than just the Canadian isms, it is a profoundly moving story of a man who has lost his footing through grief and excesses and is redeemed by music through love. And that even relieves the rheostatics. :)"

On future visits, however, I was offered more than just masterful filming. This image has a unique voice that will be reflected throughout the history of film history. <br /> <br /> The inaugural assembly offers a great palette for Helmer JP Sarro to establish his art on this entertainment screen. <br /> <br /> Sarro really uses the camera as a brush, as he takes us on a ride that wraps the audience into a massive action movie that goes beyond the traditional format we've got used to and dives deep in dark themes of betrayal, revenge, and the importance of camaraderie. This movie is the dream of every director. <br /> <br /> However, Sarro was not alone in this epic quest. The writing provided by scribe Tim Sheridan was just as breathtaking. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was so precise and direct that it gives the actors such presence and charisma on the screen. More specifically, the last scene (WARNING: SPOILERS !!! SPOILERS !!!), in which Vanessa shows herself as one of the coalitions and as a villain, is written in such a dark tone that she is one of the most frightful endings I have ever seen. Sheridan is the next Robert Towne. <br /> <br /> In a final note, it is obvious that this production was no small thing. <br /> <br /> That's why producer Scott Shipley deserves a lot of praise, who seems to have the creativity and genius in addition to Jerry Bruckheimer. Never before have I seen such a grandiose production with so much attention to every detail. A producer's job is one of the hardest in any movie, and Shipley makes it easy. <br /> <br /> All in all, this film combines creative writing, stunning production and masterful direction. This is the art of the film at its best.

I found Blakey particularly funny, though I could not swear at any time in the trilogy that he said his slogan, ""I'll get you butler."" <br /> <br /> After seeing Holiday in the Buses, the jokes started wearing thin and these three films could be compared to an early Hammer trilogy, Dick Barton, since the second movie is the best (though this is probably the only way they can be compared to) Only people who want to watch this movie are probably fans of the TV series who will undoubtedly enjoy it, and Hammer executors like me.

I can only think that it was a very bad year - even for Hollywood standards. With Huston as director and Jack Nicholson and Kathleen Turner as leader, I would probably have swallowed the bait and looked at it anyway, but the Oscar nominations really sold it to me, and I feel clearly betrayed by it. <br /> <br /> So it's a black comedy, right? Can someone tell me where the humor is in Prizzi's honor? It is undoubtedly tasteless (shooting a policewoman in the head is just a supposedly comic interlude in that intended farce about mafia life), but with the exception of a joke about ""your favorite Mexican cigars"" (for which I think old joke) Americans who were officially banned from buying Cuban products for 50 years) I have not discovered anything comic - and I've tried. There's a lot of mafia cliché, but cliché is not a humor in my book. <br /> <br /> Is it a kind of romantic comedy? Never. The characters and their relationships are so incredible and flat that in Gigli they are equivalent to Ben Afleck and Jennifer Lopez. <br /> <br /> Is it a nifty parody about the mafia? Not in a million years. The plot is simply pointless absurd and not weird absurd and it usually just feels like a really bad (and cheaper) mafia movie. It feels more like a tribute than a parody. <br /> <br /> With one-dimensional characters and little humor written for them, the actors remain dubious accents and make faces. Well, it is not enough; even if the face is drawn by this master of funny expression, Jack Nicholson (puffy upper lip repetition ... now this is supposed to be a parody of Brando's padded cheeks in The Godfather? ... Oh! cares ... everything I do knows, is not funny). <br /> <br /> Throw in a slow, busy direction (this movie lasts 2 hours), some hopelessly silly and clichéd dialogues like; ""Do you remember the Camora? Well, we're much taller, we'll track you wherever you are,"" cliché manners and you'll reach for the fast-forward button before you ""capiche?"" Can say. Prizzi's Honor is far from Huston's ""masterpiece"" and is a rather poor final work.

Jason Evers is obviously not Toshiro Mifune, and his overacting is just that. <br /> <br /> Most of the actors in this B classic were pretty good actors, except for Evers and the showgirls. If you saw this movie, you would have noticed that Evers screamed almost every line until he smoked and blew the smoke coolly from his nose. <br /> <br /> The special effects were normal in a B-movie like this one. In hindsight, I do not notice much, which is fantastic good or bad for this movie."
10,tt0389326,1,"A semiserious, often rollicking, multigenerational insider's look at the origins of surfing, the colorful and subversive birth of surf culture, and the mythology and lure of the big wave. This passionate and fluid film is without question the first authentic history of surfing from its humble Hawaiian beginnings to the big business it became to the still-rebellious universe it inhabits today. Riding Giants is a study in individuality and freedom, the pursuit and techniques of pure kinetic pleasure, and the risk taking and attitudes that characterize its leading figures. For some viewers, this is perhaps more than they ever wanted to know. But Peralta's detailed knowledge of the surfing lifestyle, its icons and locations, its boom and exploitation by the media, and the fascination it has held for young men for more than five decades is unparalleled and fuels this expedition for the expert and initiate alike. Closely chronicling the sometimes-life-and-death drama that big-wave riding ...","Riding Giants is a brilliant documentary that dives deep into the world of one of the most underrated sports and brings to the surface a very human and raw emotion that only director Stacy Peralta could capture. Everything, from the structure to the players to the amazing footage, to the style in which it was filmed, only enhanced the beauty and power behind surfing. Of all the surf movies I've seen (Endless Summer, Billabong Odyssey and Step Into Liquid), this was the most consistent and relevant. Beginning with the early days of surfing (a short history lesson) that lasts all the way to Laird's notorious ride, Riding Giants continues into the mind, heart, and soul of the sport than any other of these documentary films. How does it do it? By engaging in the entire story from beginning to end, without fictionalising or jigging from wave to wave. <br /> <br /> At first this movie was structurally sound. In the other films I've seen about surfing, you sometimes jump from a new person to a new person, from wave to wave, from event to event, without knowing why or who? In Riding Giants we have a very small cast of veterans and newcomers. That way, you can really immerse yourself in the mind of everyone. Instead of just rippling, we get more story and more personal insight into the world than before. That really attracted me to this movie. I was impressed that instead of showing all these big waves (because it's a big wave movie), we hear stories and see what these surfers had to overcome to get to those waves. I loved the information about the ""beach freaks"" or the surfers of the father. The incredible stories of Greg Noll and his early deep blue deep adventures are still on the ground. To see him in person and talk about what was going on in his head, he just added more fuel to the fire. The straightforward structure followed by Peralta enabled me to learn more about the sport than the previous films. Peralta shows so much emotion and passion that you can not wonder what these brave people have done and where the sport is heading. <br /> <br /> Add some intense and creative camera to a flawless structure, damn almost perfect movie. With techniques I've recently seen in The Kid Stays in the Picture, Riding Giants creates some scenes that almost feel like they're jumping out of the screen. Although it's not 3D, it's the flat sense of dimension you get when you put two images on top of each other. It worked in this movie. It adds more depth to the scenes, adding not only to the shock (the waves were huge), but also to the danger these guys were constantly facing. If it broke or maneuvered wrongly, those waves would kill her. Some have died, but the sport has not stopped. It just created more excitement and more passion to do better. It is this love of the sea and the sport that leads me to my last point. <br /> <br /> The human element. So many of my previous adventures in the world of documentary surfing have left me with beautiful waves, but little about humans. The movies knew that people were looking for the waves, so basically it went from wave to wave to wave and maybe a brief second over the person. This movie was the direct opposite. Peralta created this masterpiece by still giving us the waves but paying so much attention to the surfers and the immortal question of why they do it every day. What penetrates her thoughts, what drives her to go further, and the bonds that form out there on the wild blue. I felt that after this movie, I did not just know more about big wave surfing, but also about the emotional side of the sport. This was an element that was not developed as in the other films, and brought Riding Giants to a whole new personal level. <br /> <br /> Overall, the movie was brilliant. I have never seen so much passion, dedication and love in a structurally sound film. I was impressed from the beginning to the end. I would be very happy if this year's film won the Oscar for Best Documentary, seeing a new rebirth in the world of surfing and opening more doors to films of this kind. <br /> ** from *****"

Since zombies seem to be so commonplace in this movie that they run over a couple here and there, casually talking about it at a gas station (one with an in-house windshield repair, but no indoor bath), the zombie movie genre is not even one Factor to the end, even if a cameo of a dozen zombies that tear off a girl's clothing is not really a zombie movie. <br /> <br /> On to the vampires: Apparently, all zombies are male and all are vampires I am not sure how vampires are in daylight or why / why a soldier - vampire stood in the middle of the street and still holds his weapon with a stake through his heart and waits only for the queen of the vampires to rifle through it all, the last section in the old convent made no sense, and when a hot lesbian vampire asks the other hot lesbian vampire, ""Do you think we have the right g etan? ""By killing the two apparent heroes in the film, the whole thing was exaggerated. The drama and special effects were at a historic low. You could almost see the hoses pumping out the wrong blood during the close-up of the zombie run over by the general. Speaking of General, where did you like THAT Kenny Rogers anyway? No idea what he was the General apart from generally confusing and misguided ones. All in all, watch the movie if you have nothing better to do or if you have a strong urge to waste $ 3.

One of the smartest Greek series of all time! Actors like Ketty Konstadinou and Maria Kavogianni showed a whole new dimension of themselves and their talents and gave us moments of incredible ""guilty"" laughter. Every onlooker seemed to recognize the bad side of his self in one of the characters, or at least on one side of his self that he wished. Actors of all ages playing ever larger and smaller roles gained just as much space in the heart of the Greek public. My personal favorites (apart from the first two I've mentioned) are Vassilis Haralambopoulos, Athinodoros Prousalis and Stavros Nikolaidis, but so many amazing actors have passed through some episodes from time to time. Anyone who understands Greek all over the world should find a way to see it, even though it has been on television for more than five years.

Unfortunately, it's not customizable, but not because the jokes are not funny - some of them (I do not say most), and in fact, Mr. Mike has done a good job translating his mentally unbalanced screeds into visual gags. The problem is that the technical quality (sets, lighting, sound, editing, you name it) is so horrible that the movie is unbearable. Some outfits named ""PKO Productions"" receive the production credit, but do not look at all; It looks like Mike stole one of the cameras from the SNL kit and did it one afternoon. I understand that Mike's goal was to torment the audience, but it also deserves some basic standards, such as the ability to actually see, hear, or understand what's shocking. Nevertheless, the DVD is not a total waste: it contains a laudatory speech on O'Donoghue by Bill Murray and three ""Mr. Mike's favorite bedtime stories"" by SNL.

As Pym enters his career in the British Secret Service, his relationship with Axel and the values he developed in childhood lead him down his own path of betrayal and loyalty.","Undoubtedly the best of the novels of John Le Carre, exquisitely transformed into a classic movie. Performances by Peter Egan (Magnus Pym, The Perfect Spy), Rudiger Weigang (Axel, real name Alexander Hampel, Magnus 'Czech secret service), Ray McAnally (Magnus Con-Man-Father) and Alan Howard (Jack Brotherhood, Magnus' Mentor) (Believer and British controller) are so perfect and natural along with the rest of the characters that the person responsible for the cast would have received a prize. Even the small parts like Major Membury are executed perfectly. For the power of performance and the strength of the novel's characters, much is said that despite the duplicity of Magnus, one can not help but feel closer to Magnus and Axel than Jack Brotherhood and the slimy Grant Lederer of US Intelligence.

Alexandre learns that Veronika is a promiscuous woman that loves to shag and introduces her to Marie. They have a threesome and Alexandre has a crush on Veronika.","This film is so complex that it can be described in any way and still play along. They have an insecure, restless and intriguing protagonist (played by Jean-Pierre Léaud) trapped between two (no, three) women. We hear his social, philosophical and moral idiosyncrasies in endless monologues, we see him surround his three magical women he loves. This could be the premise for a poultry movie that is full of stiff, cold, uninteresting comments. Director Jean Eustache, however, manages to keep it fresh, ironic and funny. Since it's such a long film, it's imperative to laugh when Jean-Pierre Léaud suddenly shouts on the phone after two hours of polite speech, recalling a cheesy line from a movie. These situations are purely filmic and can not be completely restored in a commentary. Still someone can restore the tragic and painfully beautiful monologue by Françoise Lebrun towards the end of the film. 3 1/2 hours and worth every minute."

In an effort to monopolize the opportunities the war-torn nation offers, the corporation's CEO hires a troubled hit man, to kill a Middle East oil minister. Now, struggling with his own growing demons, the assassin must pose as the corporation's Trade Show Producer in order to pull off this latest hit, while maintaining his cover by organizing the high-profile wedding of Yonica Babyyeah, an outrageous Middle Eastern pop star, and keeping a sexy left wing reporter in check.","Joshua Seftel's first film - a satire of memorable proportions - is about what the title says: the impact of corporations on the war. <br /> <br /> The film is about a mercenary (John Cusack) traveling to Turaqistan (not a real movie) country, fyi) to help the American government to convey its message to the leaders of Turaqistan. He meets a reporter (Marisa Tomei) and we all know what will happen to a lonely man + a hot reporter. Somewhere in the mix, a pop star named Yonica Babyyeah is thrown in. When Yonica marries one of Turaquistan's most important people (a son of the president), a subplot is created in which the mercenary has to oversee that star. The movie starts with a lonely cusack in a bar; no more than fifteen seconds later, the film captivates. With its amusing and fascinating insights into terrorism and politics, the running time of the film is influenced by you. The movie has much more action than I expected, with occasional theaters of war, well-choreographed battles, and only a few murderous scenes. Although the story is not very deep, the film's simplicity makes the movie perfect for both the common man and film critic. <br /> <br /> In the final act of the film, everything revolves around the simplicity very hostile and confused. I thought it was done very well, but others may disagree, and I could understand why. Twist-by-Twist is the ultimate goal, and like most movies, it's a real hit / miss situation. Regardless, the film's three authors (Mark Leyner, Jeremy Pikser & John Cusack) did a fantastic job creating a realistic and entertaining satire about the current overseas situation. Joshua Seftel does an outstanding job to assure the film's integrity; not reduce the material to the most superfluous films (which I feared would happen). Seftel has made the movie as perfect as possible: he has created a lively atmosphere that explores both the harsh reality and the caricature craving. - perfect contrast - and the movie feels as if you would see everything. Seftel really gets you into the action and it's worth it. No missteps here. Hopefully he'll do more directing jobs, because he's one of the directors to watch out for."

The cast is mostly awful and above all very average. Jacqueline Lovell is her exceptionally attractive self and manages to lay bare her breasts and fumble between sex files. It also fits in with a little lesbian activity. To be honest, Lovell deserves so much better than this kind of fare.

It's the worst movie I've seen in the last decade - no exaggeration. <br /> <br /> As a veteran of the US Army of the war in Afghanistan, it was almost impossible to finish this ridiculous movie, not because it brought back memories - far from it - but because there was absolutely no attempt To find ""authenticity"" somewhere in the movie. Not so much the smallest shred. It seemed as if it had been written by an eight-year-old child who got all his ideas about war (and soldier behavior) directly from comics. The film was filmed in Honduras, which was supposed to be a clue, but even that can not fully explain the gruesome output of this stereotyped garbage. I could try to list endless technical defects, but it would take forever.

3,tt0354690,0,Based on a comic book series. A woman burned at the stake in 15th century Sweden actually is Satan (Lucifer)'s daughter - and plots revenge against him.,"First and foremost I would like to tell you that I like comics, anime, animations and the like. It's true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me in this movie. I will be objective. It's okay to start the story. Follow the history of comic books as far as I know them. But the animation ... Well, it's not really terrible, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate the anime style and stick to the original cartoon style drawings. If we pretend we do not see the rare, sloppy effects of fire and lightning, you could say that the movie was shot about 10 years ago and even more. Looks a bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. Take Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for example - four years ago they made a movie that looks much better! In addition, the vocal talents do nothing special, the music is nothing special. All in all - there is a lack of atmosphere. I saw it, but I can not say that I really enjoyed it. It just does not catch you. There is a lot of blood and violence, but that does not impress me at all. Maybe it's shocking for someone who has never seen more mature animations and sees animated blood for the first time (is there anyone around?), But I do not think that's the audience for this movie. So they could add some nudity and spice. The chicks around Lucifer were delicious and we have Lady Death ourselves! There are few sexy looks, but that's not enough. Instead of Bill Brown's music, I think it would look better on a hard rock / heavy metal soundtrack. All in all, the movie is not that bad, but if you want something better, take the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Ralph Bakshi's Fire and Ice or Wizards. And of course - vampire hunter D: Bloodlust"

While the five members of the crew are in deep sleep a mysterious shape is captured on one of the surveillance monitors. Awakened the crew soon discover that one of their number has been killed, and something is living among them in the shape of a crewmate. But who is it??","OK. I admit. I'm one of the nerds who spent many hours with my beloved DVD player and my wonderful television to watch science fiction series. Star Trek (Next Generation) was my first space event and since then I've been changing partners regularly. I've seen them all, it seems, and my favorites are ""Lexx,"" ""Farscape,"" and the new ""Battlestar Galactica,"" in other words, the latest space operas. But I'm generally into the old-fashioned, the cheap, the crush, like the great, four-year BBC show ""Blakes7."" Here are the budgets smaller than hobbits, the special effects seem to have been made on a Commodore 64, but who cares if the scripts are written sharp and intelligent with dark humor, the real dead are serious and sometimes even high class? > <br /> But why do you always speak English in the future? Because this is NOT the future, it's fantasy for kids. Still, it can be irritating at times. I, as a Norwegian, have often condemned this terrible fact that you never make genres such as science fiction for Scandinavian viewers. I never thought that this could have happened. But in fact, even in my homeland, Norway. I was two years old when the so-called Fjernsynsteatret (Television Theater Division) of our state public broadcaster Nrk produced this version with three episodes of Blindpassasjer (The Stowaway). When I first heard about it, I was not surprised that the show has been shown only once in Norway so far, which makes it impossible for me to actually see it. It has also been shown on Swedish, Danish and Finnish television at the time, but that was a long time ago. There was no video or DVD release, no surprise, and when it was shown in an arthouse cinema, it happened in Bergen, a city far away from Oslo (where I live). And another thing about ""Blindpassasjer"" did not surprise me, it was written by the two Norwegian authors Tor Åge Bringsværd and Jon Bing (Bing & Bringsværd). This duo introduced the SciFi genre to Norwegians in the 1970s; They published anthologies and wrote what they called fable prose. In my opinion, Bringsværd is the most interesting of the two writers and has written several great and entertaining novels, even masterpieces, some of them hilarious, such as Bazar and Syvsoverskens Dystre Frokost. No one but this man, also a celebrated playwright, could construct the script of Blindpassasjer. <br /> <br /> When I finally saw it, it was a weird Swede who recorded the three episodes on VCR, and the 80's finally managed to convert it to DVD and give it to me. He was a nice guy. So I sat down and looked at it, with Swedish subtitles, bad sound and some scratches and mistakes. But the thing came through and I was surprised that I finally loved it. <br /> <br /> The outdoor scenes with the spaceships and planets are better than those of Blakes7, and the recognition goes to the Caprino studios (who made the famous Flåklypa Grand Prix), and the interior of the Marco Polo (the spaceship ) works better than I expected. The drama is typically theatrical, but it works better than playing Ibsen, to put it mildly, and Bjørn Floberg has a solid role to play, as does Trini Lund. Legendary actress Henny groans her lines in a serious and relaxed tone that suits the genre, but this is an ensemble, and I'm happy to say that Ola B. Johannesen wears his mustache in the nobility and Marit Østbye a really hot room Chic of my standards. <br /> <br /> But is it really that good? Well, you have to swallow the rather abrupt end, the overbearing criticism of ""modern society"", but yes, it's not really that fantastic, but charming, cool, nostalgic and enjoyable. One and a half hours of classic Norwegian sci-fi."

The main problem with this movie is that actors can not keep the movie on their backs. Why? Because of bad script. Although Dillon, Lane and Jones try hard to take this movie to another level, there is no innovative storytelling and the direction is too common. For Matt Dillon fans, this is a movie, as well as for lovers of beautiful Diane Lane. The legendary Tommy Lee Jones is always great, but this is not a movie for him. far below his level.

Caro Diario was seen at least two-thirds of the time, but the boring and selfish third part of this movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this exceptionally self-indulgent chaos. Moretti says he feels a need to shoot this film, but he does not want it, while the viewer feels he should stick to it, but he does not want to. A film about Italian politics and elections could be intriguing, but that's not the movie. At some point, Moretti and his friends stand in front of the headquarters of the Communist Party and discuss the interviews they are preparing with the party leaders, but it is characteristic of this film that we never see any of it. Between Moretti's political desires are the events that led to the birth of his son, and the subsequent shots of the child with the baby and later with the baby Pietro (the film pulls us through several years and more than one legislature).

Heck, even the legendary filmmaker Fritz Lang counts ""Succubus"" among his personal favorites. Maybe it's me, but I thought that was a terribly boring and overly confusing movie. The opening is great and shows Janine Reynaud playing an SM act on stage. Unfortunately, it goes from here downhill. Reynaud's character is a maneater that finally kills his lover in a kind of trance. Franco had a reasonable budget to work with, and spends well with beautiful locations, beautiful photos and fascinating music. This COULD was indeed his best movie, if not for the lame and uninteresting story. It's supposed to be psychedelic, but I'd say sophomoric is a better term to describe what's shown here. Half the time, you have no idea what is going on or what exactly is said, even the short running time of 80 minutes seems to take forever. This is certainly not the best movie by Franco.

Brando goes from the contempt of the Japanese (which is natural in World War II) to fall in love with a Japanese woman and want to marry her. His performance is fine (I'm not a big fan of his acting style) and the movie is consistently wonderful. Red Buttons received an Oscar for his touching performance of another GI who falls in love with Japan (although the Japanese playing next to him did a remarkable job as well). <br /> <br /> I do not want to spoil it But the movie is a good movie with a box of handkerchiefs. <br /> <br /> This film manages to say something while being entertaining.

Now I have seen much worse, but there are much more romantic / funny comedies with John Cusack. <br /> <br /> This is a mediocre film at best. While acting was not terrible, but not great for a romantic comedy, there was little passion, little romance. There were many loose ends that did not show up or were not addressed. Unfortunately, the main characters appear as complete cowards. They do not know each other well enough to realize that they do not love the people they are working with. How do we know they are not in love? Due to the total lack of remorse both characters have to leave their finances. I can imagine a few more romantic things than the constant escape from the commitment shown by these two. The movie does not even end with a wedding scene, probably both get cold feet and drop each others like hot potatoes as soon as a commitment approaches. This film is really about two people who can not commit to anything, unlike Cusack's earlier characters, who were more than willing to make a deep commitment (Loyd in Say Anything, Martin in Grosse Pointe Blank, etc.) /> The biggest failure of this film was the total absence of any twists or anything of interest. When the movie was over, I felt like they had not climaxed into the story, which basically fits the movie: boring. No excitement about whether the two will come together, no joy in doing so, no consequences for their actions. <br /> <br /> It is sad that people are so blind to the shabbiness of this movie that they simply rebut criticism of ""Everyone is too cynical!"" Criticizing this film is not cynicism, but an unbiased examination. There are many other better romantic comedies, even with Grace Kelly or Eva Marie Saint. <br /> <br /> If you think this movie is great, try these movies, your hearts will explode: The Princess Bride, Say Anything, Big Pointe Blank, High Fidelity, Keeping the Faith, Charade, Rear Window , North by Northwest or There's Something about Mary (which is a good exploration of idealized romance over today's society)."

""The good, the bad and the ugly"" is my absolute favorite. I probably saw ""Silverado"" for the eighth time the other day because it was shown on CMT. This movie, Shiloh Falls, is undoubtedly the worst Western I've ever seen. The acting was terrible all around. They do not explain anything at the end of the mysterious compass appearance. The only good thing I can think of is the pretty Cantina girl. The conspicuously long pauses between the dialogues seemed intentional, only to make up for the time for an acceptable length of film. This movie was not even worth the new rental fee I paid in our local movie distribution. I felt like I had been robbed and would have refunded a rent if there was such a thing. The only reason I finished it was because I hate not seeing a movie to the end. I turned it off halfway because it was so bad. Ask the director better if you decide to do another. This is the kind of movie that has the potential to distract people from westerns."

He plays this character almost as much as the Thuggie leader in ""Gunga Din"". He is something to see!

A very long and cumbersome two hours and fifteen minutes. I only saw part of Cremaster 3 on DVD and thought I knew what to expect. However, experimental films like these are better digested in small steps. There are a few beautiful / horrible pictures ... including the title sequence (no joke), but if you count on these types of actions or meanings, you will experience a long, slumbering ride. I managed to stay awake (if that's a compliment), but mostly I waited for a meaning or narrative ... big mistake. Among the collection of pictures is a very ornate gift-wrapping ceremony, creating a disgusting bowl of petroleum jelly plates that are shaped with a cookie cutter and sprinkled with shrimp (this is served to the crew of the ship shown throughout the film), a large one bubbly cheese cake with a large tentacle herb in the center, and the mutual evisceration of Bjork and director Matthew Barney, which eventually leads to a bizarre type of communion, followed by their transformation into whale-like creatures. The soundtrack is sometimes nice and annoying ... sometimes even crazy. Once a song is sung by Bjork to accompany the ephemeral rituals that are played before us, and at other times there is only a constant drone of a high instrument in which a mysterious woman plays in music at the beginning and end of the film. If that sounds like it does not make sense, it's because it's NOT DOING! If this sounds like a cup of tea, you will absolutely love it! If that sounds like something you probably do not like, then stay far from it, because you'll most likely go out of the theater during the halftime, like several people at the show I attended. This is the definition of an art film. You get what you take from it. But otherwise there is not much, except a few strange things and constant construction and deconstruction rituals. I am glad that there is a place for films like this, but I can not say that I want to go through it again. However, I can not say that I do not want to see and compare any of Barney Cremaster's films from start to finish. I think, now that I know what to expect, I could enjoy something more. To give you an idea of ​​the understanding of this film, I would probably have liked it better if I had been stoned. On the other hand, it could have been twice as long as it had been then, and then it would have been REALLY cumbersome. Definitely not for everyone."

No wonder this movie was included in the recently released ""Grindhouse Experience 20 Movie Box Set"". Anything fanatic seeks to fit into a totally incoherent and seemingly improvised script! The production values ​​are extremely poor and the technical aspects are pathetic, but the extent of violence and sex can hardly be described. The film opens in a tropical sunny spot called Warriors Island, where a band of despicable monks raise the dead for no apparent reason, unless they become Kung Fu fighters. The monks also buy sexy slaves from a shabby businessman who looks like Hitler, supposedly because the woman meat gives them the necessary strength to increase their zombie army. Tourists on a passing cruise ship, including three martial artists, an LA police officer, and a whole host of gorgeous but gloomy ladies, are attacked by the Hitler's thugs for planning a trip to Warriors Island. Their lifeboat flushes the island to the coast anyway, and the monks challenge the survivors to a combat test with their zombies. Okay, how does that sound for a crazy midnight horror movie chaos? It's not over yet, as ""Raw Force"" also has piranhas, wild boat orgies, Cameron Mitchell in another embarrassing lead role, and 70-year-old exploit duchess Camille Keaton (""I spit on your grave"") in a most insignificant performance. There are a lot of poorly recognized bleedings, including ax massacres and beheadings, hammer blows, and bad taste romance. The waste value of this movie will literally make you speechless.

No point in this movie, however, was so obvious that he did not deserve close-ups. I had the feeling that I had been hit over my head with the so-called mysterious explanation for the ill people. The writer seems to have picked up clichés from other films simply as a substitute for customized writing lines to actual characters. The actors did not help. No chemistry I think they should develop some sort of attraction, if only because that is an essential element of these stories. The authors, however, did not work very hard on the development of chemistry. Sure, both are attractive, but whether they are attractive to each other seemed to be an open question. <br /> <br /> The self-confidence shown by Turner's character in Sabato's development has arisen far too quickly and for no particular reason. Sabato's character is said to be a discredited doctor who just does not seem to play by the rules. Think of the Jeff Goldblum character on Independence Day. Normally this type of character should show talent or brilliance. Sabato's character does not do it. He is Cassandra with the crazy and all the prophetic abilities of a magic eight ball. He seems to be right by accident. <br /> <br /> The death scenes are funny. Each actor really tried more than a little too hard to demonstrate the agony inflicted on him.

The tempo is very well done for those who like to think - enough is denied to the viewer at an early stage, and there are always questions that will be answered later, producing a well thought out and very satisfying film, both cerebral and action Position. <br /> <br /> It seems that some people have been looking for an uninterrupted roller coaster ride with this movie - one who storms out of the gate.

I think it has the rare quality that makes it attractive for teens, teens and adults. Everyone who reads it, I think, will leave a better person. I can not quite say that for the movie, but I'm glad they usually got it right. I do not think that viewers of the movie will go off as enriched, but they will certainly entertain without the side effect of being stupid when they sit down. It's a smart story that is told very well. I think it's moving a bit too fast. The novel needs more time to develop the characters. And the flashbacks come in and out so fast that they do not have much time to register. The interracial romance in the past feels smarter and more banal than in the novel. And the end that holds all loose threads together seems very ridiculous. It is exactly the same in the novel, but there is a sense of the absurd that does not quite exist in the film. It works much better. I also do not like the variety of pop songs. I wish Disney did not see it as a necessity to sell soundtracks. The cast is excellent across the board, from the little kids to the old pros. Jon Voight is especially great. Not sure why we need Catwoman and the Fonze. 10.9."

Maybe I saw this movie from the corrupt perspective of a theater director, but I was disappointed. I am sure that the people in ballet choreography find this production impressive, but from a purely theatrical perspective, I found everything from design to choreography to be inconclusive and unsatisfactory for a ""film"". None of the traditionally ""weird"" and impressive costumes looked like what they should be (ie, the sweets did not look like candy, the rats did not look like rats, but rather like chocolate kisses) too toned for the canvas, and the Choreography just did not do anything for me. This makes the entire show (at best) very satisfying, as if it should not stand out from any other production.

In addition, the basketball in the church is ripe with potential for lots of funny gags and the like. But I have to say, throughout the movie it seemed like nobody knew what they were doing. Every joke fell flat and every opportunity for a really funny gag was ignored. The dialogue was mild, and the movie had one of the worst character developments I've ever seen. Every single character except Wilson's was less one-dimensional. It's hard to believe that after nine rewrites, the movie was still as staggeringly stale as the train I've been through. I can not put into words the anger that made me feel. My friends and I were in the last game scene, so we went to the premiere in Washington City, UT. Kurt Hale, the director, was there, and I have to say, I avoided any contact with him after the show. He was waiting at the door, apparently ready for feedback.

She soon falls in love with Skid. Skid gets a job playing the trumpet at a local club and becomes a big success. Fame and fortune go to his head which eventually destroys his relationship Maggie and his career.","I'm pretty much the Mitchell Leisen fan, so it was a big expectation that I rented this movie, but the pressure I got was extremely bad, so worn and burned that it was apparently beyond repair Movie was so dark. So dark that you can not see anything in certain scenes that are cinematographed in the dark. That is, I think I share the same opinion as the first review of this film. It starts off unusually and does not sum up the lines and rhythms of your typical Hollywood 30's movie. Do not damn your typical Hollywod movie anytime. It seems that the director has been influenced by the Europeans because it is a certain corrosive realism from the opening shot, which is compiled in camera movement and placement as Maggie (Carole Lombard) and Skid (Fred Macmurray). They expect half of them to start singing Make believe from Show Boat. It starts with a few laughs and poor Anthony in a single role in which he does not speak a word of English beaten by Freddie. Skids is a bum who does not care that he's a bum. That's why he logs on to the army, where he can hide from the world. He has just been released, and in a series of scripting phenomena she misses her boat for New York. This is the moment when the movie is in full swing and we start to get this French movie of the 60s vibe for the whole event. The scenes were played so well by Lombard and Cecil Cunningham that the film gets a pulse. MacMurray is also good when he and Lombard fall in love with each other while promoting his talent for the trumpet. Then the temptress arrives in the form of Dorothy Lamour. Enough with action. The film has fantastic montage sequences that fascinated me. You are very good. And Lombard has a home run in this movie, but in the second half Freddie is called something more and he can not deliver the goods. With a strongly melodramatic ending and an actor you do not believe, the film misses, but as it is not the typical movie in structure, stage design and direction. It's worth a look. For what it was one of the 37 hits of the season 1936-37. I do not know what rank it has."

Like many of the critters / trolls / Gremlins movies of the 80s, this movie is bad. The sad part is that there is no point in this comment. It's just bad and not in a fun way. <br /> <br /> The problem with this miniature monster movie is that it actually tries to be funny and in the end is as successful as Howie Mandell was in Walk Like A Man. What made the other 80s horror movies classics was that they were really scary, but they were funny because they failed so miserably. Someone must have told Bettina Hirsch (yes, Bettina Hirsch) that she had a talent for comedy before she started directing. Unfortunately, they were wrong. <br /> <br /> Certainly seeing a strange little mutant cross between a ferret and a tumor wearing a brown trench coat and throwing pool balls at an outcast of the Lost Boys is amusing but not enough to save that movie , <br /> <br /> The most annoying part of the movie is the Paul character. His Paul Reiser wannabe schtick is enough to start a fast-forward from the first scene to the end of the credits, which is only stopped once to see a scene in which a munchie throws pool balls at a man ... not that I did that. <br /> So the bottom line is that you do not run to your next blockbuster and shake hands with the manager, thanking him for not having the grapes to store this pile of rubbish on the shelves."

A few things: Steve described snake fangs like hypodermic needles. yeeeowch! For real, you know it hurts. and can not you jump high? He'll grab her by the tail and all. There were two MAJOR split shots in this movie. When Terry finds the baby Joey, she goes like ""We have to take care of her, just like a baby"". Woah! I thought she would breastfeed and nurse the child. that would have been PG-13. Has anyone noticed anything in Terry and much of Terry's knowledge of ritual couples? she knows her sex stuff.

Many of the ""time facts"" were gone. At the beginning of the film, the grandfather commented on this grandson and his friends about how they felt when September 11 came. This film was to take place in 1994. In addition, one of the grandchildren wore an Eagles Donovan McNabb jersey. He had not even been drafted yet. The story was good, but the facts and the timeliness of the timeline were so far from the basics that the movie looked cheesy. My friend is an avid reader of World War II books and memorabilia. I rented this movie in the hope that it will be fine. Acting was so-so. The dog was cute. But the way this movie was performed made me happy that I only paid $ 4 for it, as opposed to the 50 I needed to watch it in a theater. I hope everyone who reads this understands that I do not mean dissatisfaction to those who waged the war, but the facts and time frame should have been more closely monitored."

Puerto Rico, which has a small but strong film production company, brings with it this multi-layered history of corruption, due to the ongoing drug cartel that begins in South America, a stop on the Commonwealth of the island and then North to the North invites America. Steven Bauer, the most famous face on the screen, is leading a string of first-class actors. In a story of ""Can you see the only handsome face in the crowd?"".

But one fateful night left four people dead and John as a key suspect in one of the most grisly murders in Los Angeles. Was he partly responsible for what happened at Wonderland Avenue?","Some films survive almost exclusively with originality - ""Wonderland"" is certainly one of those films. The script manages to throw everything in an almost feverish mood, but without incoherent. The speed of this thriller is not to choose to cover up a weak script, but to accurately reflect the drug-dependent reality. <br /> <br /> As a director, James Cox acts as a very special way to work his actors. Most characters are constantly on the up and often because they are pretty ugly personalities. Val Kilmer has described John Holmes as a hustler capable of manipulating and controlling. Not an insult to Kilmer, but his version of Holmes seems to dominate only the drastically weak. Nevertheless, it is an amazing achievement. Comparing this to Kilmer's more ""Hollywood"" roles as in ""The Saint"", he seems to prove that he is much more at home in edgy indie films. <br /> <br /> The actors are the main force that holds everyone together. There are several small performances that stand out - especially the women. Carrie Fisher, Kate Bosworth, and Lisa Kudrow have only a limited screen time in addition to their male counterparts, but they are all fantastic. Apart from Kilmer, Ted Levine and Dylan McDermott give their roles a crazy, breathtaking energy. <br /> <br /> I originally watched ""Wonderland"" because I assumed it was a movie about a porn actor. Yes, the story revolves around John Holmes, but it has literally nothing to do with his professional career. Basically, this movie is a murder mystery and as such - it's excellent. <br /> <br /> RATING: 7.5 out of 10"

Brian Krause, whom I thought was awful, to the point where the satire felt incredibly forced plays the loud, spirited director who dislikes the fact that his second director and scriptwriter Alison (played by Dahlia Salem will) seem to take over the production. Andrew Moxham is Paul Parsons, the brother of a victim from the first movie. The film's dark humor takes on the idea of ​​a serial killer who actually directs a movie set, and uses it for anything worthy of it. Nelson glides back into his psycho role without difficulty. Stanley is as smart as ever, using his brain to command a movie production, killing everyone he needs to have full control of his work, leaving no one in his position ... until Alison realizes who Stanley really is. Alison is the kind of ambitious writer who wants to capture the essence of her theme ... what motivated Stanley to kill, why would he do that, and what led such a man to that dark path? The humor of Alison, who actually works with this man, is also part of the satire in the heart of this dark comedy thriller. Of course you get the inevitable showdown between Alison and Stanley, with a really ridiculous, unbelievable conclusion regarding the fate of the killer (quite hard to swallow). Unlike the first film, which was photographed with sophisticated polish, director Po-Chih Leong uses unnecessary techniques that are not needed (such as shooting all sorts of angles, slow-motion sepia, and multiple examples) captured on video ) and rather annoy instead of impress. This sequel was simply not as good as the original for me, with a lot of humor less effective and obvious."

I remember Richard Burton's character, who looked so hopelessly lost, and then remembered how his motivation had not been transferred to me. In short, I remember ""Circle of Two"" because it was so phenomenally awful. <br /> <br /> This film appeared at a time when America underwent a fairly disturbing phase of the fascination of unhealthy or twisted angles in youth sexuality. Remember ""The Blue Lagoon"" (and other annoyances of Brooke Shields), ""Lipstick"", ""Little Darlings"", ""Beau Pere"" and other films that are especially popular with teenagers who have sex, especially in adults seem to be. As a teenager at that time, I found the obsession, combined with the sexual excesses of the 70s and 80s, for an unconsciously disturbing environment in which I could sort out everything. <br /> <br /> ""Circle of Two"" is not executable or unnecessarily insulting, like ""Blue Lagoon.""

It reminds me of some (beloved) Italian horror movies. But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarish / frightening moment. It just goes on and on and on and then it has to end (logically). More exciting and bolder images and his fate as a cult classic would have been sealed."

In this segment, Gene Simmons (who had played a cameo) and several other interviewees discussed how horrible this movie is.

The benefit of such an attitude is half the time I realize that the movies are not nearly as bad as people said, and I enjoy them much more than I had originally expected. That was my experience with Trick or Treat. Well, it's hard to make a movie about a teenager who gets news from a dead heavy metal star by playing one of his vintage records backwards without people making fun of the prerequisites. Sure, it's certainly a strange premise, but one that has never been done! Give the filmmakers points for the originality around Pete's sake! If you want to buy the DVD without first knowing about the movie, do not think that Ozzy Osbourne and Gene Simmons are the stars. Although Simmons plays a thankless role, Ozzy has a funny cameo as Reverend (that's right, a Reverend !!) that speaks out against Heavy Metal. For one, it's funny to see Ozzy with short hair. And second, you can not help but laugh at the irony. Sure, it's a cheap shot, but an effective one. Acting is pretty good. I found the performances convincing. The teenage characters are terribly cliched. So expect the usual range of jocks and nerds. And as in any of these movies, the pretty girl is a decent person who has sympathy for the alienated main character, but still goes on with her friend from Jock. Why is she ever going out with such a complete jerk? Because the plot needs an obstacle. No other reason. But I can not deny that one of my guilty amusements witnessed the descent of the evil jocks in these movies because I was an outsider in high school. The film was largely upholding my interest, but the third act is far too conventional, causing me to roll my eyes as there would be one predictable situation after another. Overall, the film is not bad and on a rainy day definitely worth seeing. (7 out of 10)"

What Cecil does not know is that the creature, when chopped up, regenerates into many new creatures -- and are they mean!","No hit on Korman since he was very funny on the Carol Burnett show. He was also good at playing secondary characters in Mel Brook's films (""High Anxiety""). However, he is not a person who can wear a movie in dueling roles. This is basically a Gremlins effect following a tradition of films like Critters and Ghoulies. It's also not a very good knockoff, comparable to ""ghoulies,"" but with a much brighter tone, since it's not as dark as the movie came to be. In fact, this is too light and frothy and unfortunately many jokes fall flat. Even though I've awarded a 3 for a score, it's just because there's a movie that's even worse than ""Gremlin"". If you've seen Mystery Science Theater 3000, you know the one I'm talking about ... the infamous ""hobgoblins"". This one has a guy who finds a little creature in an underground place (I saw this movie a long time ago, so I can not remember everything) and it starts off nicely. However, this creature quickly becomes rude and of course more is produced and that is the movie. More failures than hits in the joke section, and it's also very lame to see Korman playing the role of the bad brother. It's best to skip this, but then you might just want to look for kicks."

If you get that feeling and the movie actually fulfills those expectations, the experience is rare. I had that feeling throughout the movie. Robert DeNiro and Cuba Gooding Junior played fascinating and amazingly strong parts, both of which were Oscar-worthy. The side cast was just as strong and created a profitable base on which to grow the picture. I can say without hesitation to see this movie, it will not disappoint."

Esteban tries to stop the love affair between Pedro and his daughter by all means possible but soon Blanca becomes pregnant and has a daughter. The void between father and daughter seems unbridgeable when Blanca moves in with Pedro.","This is one of the few films I have seen twice in the theater. I love this movie because of its atmosphere and its life about the tragic hero Esteban Trueba. He makes so many mistakes, but gets a chance to salvation. Is not that a comforting thought? <br /> <br /> When I saw it for the first time, I thought the movie would be over after the election wins - I did not know the book. I was wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come! I was literally swept along by the sheer power of the last half hour of the movie. <br /> <br /> Many people here do not like this movie. I can not understand this. Perhaps those who read the book first, as is often the case with screen adaptations of novels, are simply disappointed that so many things remain unimagined, unseen, unexplained. But as a film that tells a touching story - the story of a family, the ups and downs of a man, the deep pity of a woman, the power of love and the madness of hatred (and conservatism) - this movie is just great! Plus the soundtrack is amazing and the cast is wonderful too - especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Irons. <br /> <br /> Definitely one of those films for which the cinema was invented!"

Third, how Cinderella taught one of her nasty stepsisters how to smile which leads to her own true love.","Although Cinderella is not the obvious choice for a sequel, I love Jaq and Gus, so I did not hesitate. The format of the mice writing a book for Cinderella was inspired. I like to write stories myself and hope that children will be encouraged. The three stories are sweet and amusing, though the songs were forgotten. Jaq and Gus were my favorite characters, but I also enjoyed seeing Lucifer, Bruno, the Mice Chorus and everyone else. Pom Pom proved to be the perfect companion for Lucifer and I liked the governess. A sequel that was made right for a change. My rating 8/10"
1,tt0399877,0,"""WHAT THE #$*! DO WE KNOW?!"" is a radical departure from convention. It demands a freedom of view and greatness of thought so far unknown, indeed, not even dreamed of since Copernicus. It's a documentary. It's a story. It's mind-blowing special effects. This film plunges you into a world where quantum uncertainty is demonstrated - where neurological processes, and perceptual shifts are engaged and lived by its protagonist - where everything is alive, and reality is changed by every thought.","""What the bleep do we know?"" was one of the worst times I spent in the cinema. It was less a movie and more of a post-school special, but nothing special at the same time. The attempt of a narrative in which they founded their ideas was utterly pathetic, which almost everyone will say. Marlee Matlin in her underwear just should not happen. I will not go into that further. What I am going to reveal is a criticism that many can not formulate. Although this film was boring, but also had a big mistake. It was terribly contradictory because it was so manipulative to become a creator of your life, manifestation of abundance, shoeless propaganda. Interconnectivity is declared as a big party of our existence. However, the film encourages us to control our environment with our minds. It completely neglects that there are other people with brains who could control us, which seems to be more the case. Or at least the structures in which we exist restrict us greatly. In this way, the film was inappropriately solipsistic. Solipsism and networking just do not mix, unless you are the almighty God. If you are, you will be impressed (?!?) Of all the nice things this movie will show you can do. If not, you'll be painfully disappointed, an idiot, or maybe both. Besides, the title is so ridiculous. I have trouble warning people not to watch the movie because I feel left behind when I mention it by name. Shame on all involved."

Detective Columbo arrives and suspects the writer of murder but clues are few and far between.,"I love this episode of Columbo. Maybe it's because Ruth Gordon is there and she is wonderful as a wonderful mystery writer Abigail Mitchell, an American version of Dame Agatha Christie. She is a delicious sight as the naughty, lovable author who suffered a terrible loss when her niece died of a drowning accident. She accuses the husband of her niece, the nephew. She plans to kill him to avenge her death since the police left her. I would have loved it if someone other than Mariette played Hartley Veronica. I never like Hartley personally. And with Columbo, of course, there are some laughs when he asks Veronica in a belly dance class.

On the way of the meeting, he confesses that they had traveled from Houston to New York to satisfy the wish of the reckless Kyle, who is his best friend since their childhood, of eating a sandwich from club 21 and the meeting was just a pretext to Kyle's father Jasper Hadley. Mitch and Kyle immediately fall in love for Lucy, and Kyle unsuccessfully uses his money to impress Lucy; then he opens his heart and proposes Lucy. They get married and travel to Acapulco and the insecure Kyle stops drinking. Meanwhile, Kyle's sister Marylee is an easy woman and has a non-corresponded crush on Mitch that sees her as a sister. One year later, Kyle discovers that he has a problem and might be sterile and starts drinking again. The ...","WRITTEN ON THE WIND, directed by Douglas Sirk and released in 1956, is like all the movies from Sirks in the mid-fifties - pure melodrama. It is, however, a captivating, richly-developed melodrama, and Sirk's distinctive lurid color expressionism, throbbing, barely suppressed emotions, symbolism, and class juxtaposition make this movie a covetous movie of four central characters, and the plot introduced as credits continues. Sirk uses a clever flashback structure to bring us into his world ... <br /> <br /> Robert Stack and Dorothy Malone are great as the two Hadley kids ""Kyle"" and ""Marylee"". He drinks and sleeps with women. She drinks and sleeps with men. Both are worth millions thanks to Hadley's oil business. The weak but poor Mitch Wayne (Rock Hudson) is Kyle's lifelong friend and Marylee's dream lover. Enter into this messy mess Lucy Moore (Lauren Bacall), a slender, attractive young woman who falls under Kyle's charm after picking up a phone and flying over the landscape one evening. Mitch loves her too, but Kyle wins her. They marry quickly and Kyle stops drinking. But fate seems to be about the wind, and it does not take long for a seductive Marylee (who will have Mitch or a marriage), a stealthy Mitch, the confused Lucy and the sad, drunken Kyle to strike. ... <br /> <br /> Malone is just wonderful as Marylee Hadley, who earned her Oscar for Best Supporting Actress. She steals every scene she's in. Stack is almost as good, reinforcing the melodrama while maintaining subtle and quiet desperation. Hudson and Bacall are much more restrained than these two, but it suits the characters they play. <br /> <br /> So, what's the whole melodrama really about? Well, many things. Stack's powerful portrait of male inadequacy and fear, for one. Sirk surrounds Stack with phallic symbols throughout the movie. Notice its tiny little rifle, the oil derricks and the ultimate phallic symbol. Kyle's apparent inability to conceive children. Stack seems to be suffering from a massive male superiority complex compounded by his father's preference for Hudson, his sister's longing for Hudson, and the suspicion that his wife is going on with Hudson. With all the wealth, Kyle Hadley still lands at the wrong end of the city and buys cheap corn brandy like a ""bum."" <br /> <br /> It's about impossible dreams and letting go of them. The river on which Kyle, Marylee and Mitch played when they were children is constantly referred to throughout the film as a reference symbolizing Kyle and (especially) Marylee's desire for innocence and simplicity of youth. In an excellent melodramatic scene, which Malone demolishes perfectly, Marylee stands by the river and introduces herself as a child, with Mitch's voice telling Marylee that she will always be his girl. Here Sirk meets the viewer with a huge emotional chord. Who has not dreamed of returning to this special place in childhood? Who has not lived on a cherished memory at some point? Who did not want something that they could not have? And Hudson's last line of the movie (yes, he does not get any dialogues in the last 10 minutes, just close-ups) remembers how far we came from the river, Marylee. Amazing."

Twenty filmmakers have five minutes each; the audience must weave a single narrative out of twenty moments. The 20 moments are fused by transitional interstitial sequences and also via the introduction and epilogue. Each transition begins with the last shot of the previous film and ends with the first shot of the following film, extending the enchantment and the emotion of the previous segment, preparing the audience for a surprise, and providing a cohesive atmosphere. There's a reappearing mysterious character who is a witness to the Parisian life. A common theme of Paris and love fuses all.","Although I live in Minnesota, I have recently studied in France and came across this bizarre jewel of a movie. <br /> <br /> This movie was amazing, to say the least. A creative and unique film, which the different directors each interpreted differently than their interpretation of love in the city of light. The first instinct is to try to fit each of these little stories into an overall storyline, similar to Love Actually in 2003. However, this attempt makes the magic of each segment obsolete. If you take them at face value and consider each of the short segments as your own individual film, the love stories together convey a beautiful message. <br /> <br /> The film is sometimes strikingly bizarre - often to the point of confusion - and every single segment can be hard to follow. However, for an observer who closely observes each segment, the short plotting lines become clear after a short time. The confusion is almost fascinating. They stay on the edge of the seat waiting for what comes next. The viewer asks: ""Did that really just happen?"" but they are also satisfied that it actually happened. It is a kind of film in which the viewer can not really decide when he leaves the theater whether he loved him or if he hated him. The first reaction is to look at it again and again just to see how these individual lives merge into a cinematic masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The interesting decision to make the film multilingual adds something to the range of people it can relate to. It contributes to the reality of the film - here the American tourists speak English, the Parisian French and so on. The number of people the film encompasses leads to an understanding of the international language of love. <br /> <br /> From Illness to the Supernatural, Parents 'Love for Husbands' Love: This film covers all the basics of romantic storytelling.

Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the man with stars in the eyes of the wrong side of the city.

That she had fame and was undeserved is often speculated. Given the Mawkian dramas she has been so often pushed into, this critique seems to have some validity. As a comedienne, however, her star shone very well. She had a career in light comedy and slapstick, she might have been able to compete with Mabel Normand. Her better outings included King Vidor's Show People (1928), who survive and are so well known because MGM has filled them with star cameos. This fortunate coincidence inadvertently saved what is undoubtedly one of the best works of his two stars, Davies, and notorious Joe College joker William Haines. Rumor has it that Show People is based on the life of Gloria Swanson, who began in Sennett comedies and a big drama (and do not think she did not spend the rest of her life reminding everyone!) Spent with Walsh of Stroheim and DeMille. Coincidentally, the comedy studios used in this film are the original excavations Keystone abandoned a year ago (think who worked there!).

Peggy soon works at High Art Studios, changing her name to Patricia Pepoire, leaving poor Billy behind. Davies makes a wonderful show of a serious actress, with all the necessary fluttering eyelashes and trembling lips. Vidor launches a parade of stars having lunch in a long tracking shot (and they're all sitting shoulder to shoulder in front of the camera!), Including Polly Moran (who's also a sensational joker playing Davies's maid), Louella Parsons (one of the friendly vampires), Estelle Taylor, Claire Windsor Aileen Pringle, the comedy duo of Karl Dane (with the arm in a sling) and George K.

When her character tries to ""act,"" it's as if Davies makes fun of all the horrible dramas she's been forced into, and she's brilliant at doing it. <br /> <br /> Although true, Show People is a hokey satire The good old days ten years ago are still an extremely entertaining example of the quality work of MGM Irving Thalberg and her enormous wealth of gathered talent.

He's certainly proved that he was still a master of horror with ""Cigarette Burns"", but ""Pro-Life"" is perhaps the worst thing I've seen of him, it's welcome beyond time, despite the running time of less than an hour. The script is nonsense, the characters are cranky and unsightly, and the conclusion is utterly absurd. <br /> <br /> And for the jerks who actually bought the DVD (one of them was me); Did you see how Carpenter describes the film? He is really proud of this and talks a long time about it as his best work, and he praises the script. And in the commentary track, where he notices an obvious flaw that made it to the final cut, he just says he does not feel it necessary to correct the mistake, and he just left it there. I'm afraid the old master has completely lost his touch. I sincerely hope that I proved wrong. <br /> <br /> I would like to make a positive comment and mention that the creature effects are great though.

In fact, the best part is tackling the beginning of the trader, which contains some nasty Goth chicks covered in blood and showing off their boobs - and again - this is definitely not worth the price of the garbage. As everyone else has noted, the title of the movie is completely nonsensical, since there is absolutely no bloodsucker or dance of any kind in the movie at all. It could just as well have been called ""the goat-raper leads the circle joke"", and at least it would have had a better title, which also concerns nothing in the film. An exact title would have been ""90 Minutes of Torture"" - another tantalizing title that would have been at least true ... for the viewer.

Yeah, this is one of those movies where pretty much everyone is despicable, so they'll rejoice when they die, and really the selection of actors, locations, etc. could not be better, lending the movie an air of shabby decadence , <br /> <br /> Tremayne's character is ""Snakey Bender,"" and he's certainly the most interesting thing about the film: an old snake collector obsessed by John Philip Souza's music. As the local preacher suppresses his practice of collecting small animals from local schoolchildren as bait for his snakes and his friend marries a stripper (which disturbs his ritual Wednesday evening concert), he sets out on a rampage. He creates a memorable pile of clunkers under the cliff, where he dumps the wrecks after disposing of his unfortunate owners. An entertaining game you can play while watching ""Snakes"" is placing bets with the cars landing furthest down the cliff. All in all very cheap and exploitative, but will really be a lot of fun for fans of this type of movie."

I did that with some concern because films that win prizes in Cannes are usually very good or very bad. Unfortunately, this falls into the latter category. About a quarter of the way inside, I said aloud, ""This movie is boring."" Halfway, I said to myself, ""Where have I seen this?"" At the three-quarter mark I had found out. <br /> <br /> Despite its literary heritage, this film is essentially a remake of Robert Altman's much earlier (1969) and better: ""That Cold Day in the Park."" Although the details are obviously different and Altman's work was characterized by action rather than character studies, the two films are thematically identical. There is nothing ""new"" in this production. Every aspect of it has been done before: a character who gets out of control with increasingly self-destructive behavior (Abel Ferrara's ""Bad Lieutenant"" 1992); a perverse and doomed ""love"" ending in a (near) (almost) surefire scene (David Cronenberg's ""M. Butterfly"" 1993); unusually brutal sex scenes (David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" 1986); and so on. So I'm amused by the fact that so many felt the movie was ""shocking,"" ""shocking,"" and so on. This highly derivative film seems to be for the sole purpose of making viewers uncomfortable and obviously successful with some. However, I attribute such a reaction largely to the lack of film experience. Watch enough movies and you will have really seen everything. And while it's true that I saw the translated ""R-Rated"" version, I doubt the additional scenes would change my general opinion of ""The Piano Teacher."" Technically, the movie is not without earning. The camera works very well and the lighting is excellent. The performance of Isabelle Huppert also helps to avoid wasting time. This is the first of Hanekes films I have seen, and if I saw more I would have the same opinion of him as Ferrara: an interesting director, but not nearly the genius others do. Rating: 4/10."

It resembles Chip and Dale, Ducktales, and many of those old ones, so that it surrounds that weird feeling, I can not.

Today we see something like Ed E dd and Eddy or anything else weird, we have all these new or almost new shows like Hannah Montana or something like that, but I feel like we do not have the same spirit in cartoons or real shows like we did in the beginning. <br /> <br /> Now I may be wrong, but I feel like the time has changed too much.

This was clearly not the case with ""Dream Machine"". So we have a perfect car, yes, this black Porsche. Haim's perfect girlfriend? Only a blond chick who has hardly any lines in the film. The perfect murder ... almost? A guy who falls on his butt as the movie's villain, tries the whole movie to steal the body from the trunk is never really successful, and at the end of the movie he thinks he's Michael Myers (minus the white William) Shatner Mask) and mistaken Corey Haim for Jamie Lee Curtis. I do not think she could have made that punch if they tried. A silly, funny movie with a story that is nowhere led by a director who does not know how to control his cast.

Of course, if something is thought-provoking, it can be investigated. The reality is that this film combines metaphysics with allusions and groundless conclusions. The connection between ""what the bleep ..."" between science and spirituality is indeed not anchored in science at all. The study on transcendental meditation mentioned in the film claims that group meditation can reduce crime in a particular area, in this case Washington D.C. In fact, the HRA's crime rate (homicide, rape and assault) in 1993 was about 30% higher than the average crime rate between 1988 and 1992. There was absolutely no decrease in the homicide rate during the study. Any claim that connects metaphysics with science can and has been unmasked. <br /> <br /> My conclusion from this information is that this film is either a bad attempt to indoctrinate people, or a joke.

No wonder the Navy refused to send in a technical advisor to make this film. If a member of a submarine crew made the sounds that were traveling on that ship, they would be severely reprimanded. Submarineers learn early in their careers to be as quiet as possible to avoid detection. They do not close doors and even speak quietly and wear soft-soled shoes on the way.

I only knew what it was about when I read the story, which was not really similar to the movie. Why did the director zoom in on his practical cam and then out? It was not very artistic. Why did the director show Lulu how to file his nails for fifteen minutes? Why did the actors stop talking as if they were reading? Or was that the point?

Their respective cases are complicated when John falls for Angela, and Charles falls for Dolores.","This movie is just awful. John Ritter makes Pratt cases, 75% of the actors deliver their lines as if they were reading them from cue cards, bad editing, terrible soundmixing (dialogues are hard to hear above the background noise), and an action that's really right nowhere goes I I did not think I'd ever say that, but Dorothy Stratten is not the worst actress in this movie. There are at least 3 others who suck more. Patti Hansen delivers her lines with the passion of Ben Stein. I began to wonder if she was not dead. Even Bogdanovich's children are terrible (the oldest definitely reads their lines from a cue card). This movie is really terrible. There is a reason why Bogdanovich could not get another project until four years later. Please do not look at it. If you see it in your TV programs, cancel the cable. If a friend recommends it to you, reconsider your friendship. If your spouse wants to see it, it's better to find another soulmate. I would rather pry my eyes out with grass darts than sit down in the trash. If I could sum up this movie in one word, the word would be Suckotrocity"

They sponsor a brash, extroverted young bank clerk named Jim Corbett, who quickly becomes an accomplished fighter under the new Marquis of Queensbury Rules. Despite his success, the young Irish-American's social pretensions and boastful manner soon estrange him from his benefactors, who plot to give their conceited former protégé a well-deserved comeuppance. Despite this, his dazzlingly innovative footwork helps him to beat a succession of bigger and stronger men, and he finally finds himself fighting for the world's championship against his childhood idol, John L. Sullivan.","Gentleman Jim is not a boxing movie. It is a vehicle for Errol Flynn as Jim Corbett. However, the boxing scenes are a real eye-opener for the modern viewer. There are no 12 round point decisions. <br /> <br /> Errol Flynn plays the Irish bank employee who gets a shot at the heavyweight world title. Flynn lends itself well to the role of the polite but unpredictable Corbett. However, his opponent John Sullivan is still better, an old-school admirer whom Ward Bond plays. <br /> <br /> The theme of the film is a man who is looking for his big chance. Corbett leaves his earthly life behind and builds a new personality as a gentleman Jim. Jim is a chancer who can adapt to any social environment. He is a liar and an egotist. Sullivan, the heavyweight boxing champion, is portrayed as a simple beast, but his honesty and sportiness contrast with the main character. <br /> <br /> There is a lot of action and excitement and a wonderful ending with the necessary salvation for all. And Errol Flynn gets the girl."

The writing was downright horrible and was delivered by some of the worst acting I've seen in a long time. <br /> <br /> One thing that particularly annoyed me about this movie was that people often talked to each other there was an unnatural break between the lines. I know how to use a pause to create a sense of awkwardness (as in luck). This was not such a break - it was just bad governance. In fact, this movie could be much better with subtitles, and maybe the overseas market is the best one for this movie, because then the inner dialogue and the bad drama would not be perceived that much. <br /> <br /> I generally like those kind of little quirky movies (The Real Blonde, Walking and Talking, Lovely and Amazing) that have failed on so many levels that I think they're one of the worst movies, which I played through in the last few years."

But there's something pretty rotten going on in town, with someone pretty rotten behind it, and Tracy has his hands full with the likes of villain Big Boy Caprice and with the almost irresistible Breathless Mahoney.","When we use the word ""escapist"", we usually mean it negatively. Warren Beatty's big-screen movie ""Dick Tracy"" proves that ""escapist"" can be good. This is really a fun movie. As the same-named, fearless title character dressed in yellow, Beatty creates a detective we can all relate to: ready for action, but not without his weaknesses. <br /> <br /> From then on, the rest of the characters are almost a world apart. Tess Truehart (Glenne Headly) is as glamorous as one would expect from the man of a criminal. The breathless Mahoney (Madonna) is perhaps the most amazing person you can imagine; Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino) is the average villain: ruthless but cool. Other characters include the voice-challenged Mumbles (Dustin Hoffman), the over-musical 88 Keys (Mandy Patinkin) and The Kid (Charlie Korsmo). Charles Durning, James Caan, Dick Van Dyke, Estelle Parsons, Catherine O'Hara, Seymour Cassel, Paul Sorvino and Kathy Bates also play a role. Oh, wait a minute. I did not even explain the plot! The plot involves Tracy trying - and so far failed - to find a way to snap Big Boy. At the same time, some very bizarre events have been held in the city whose answers may be closer than anyone thinks. <br /> <br /> Of course, the most important thing about this movie is that it's fun to watch it. If Warren Beatty struggled to keep up with his age, he made good use of it. ""Dick Tracy"" is a cool movie."

Sure, it was not a copy of the books, but if you make something out of something, you need to modify it to become entertainment on big screens. The plot was enjoyable and exciting, with many real horrors, and I thought Emma Roberts really believed in her own way of portraying this classic character. There were some funny moments, and unlike many statements, Nancy never appears as Ditz in this movie. She was intelligent, conservative, polite and sincere. One thing that made this movie good was the balance between comedy, romance, suspense and heartfelt moments. I loved this movie. What a movie, what a movie! And if you are wise and decide to trust me and see this, prepare yourself for some scary moments because I was freaking out!

I do not know why, but I think he's a good guy, I just hope he's going to be a good actor. <br /> <br /> The woman, however, loved the movie, and I think there were chords to play and to which I had no ear. If the film tries to portray unusual sexual behaviors and their consequences in today's Romania, then it has failed miserably. There were no consequences. Imagine, the girls are actually a boy and a girl, and the same story just becomes a boring, uninteresting conspiracy. I have no idea why she received all these BAFTA awards. In my book it should have received the award ""Better luck next time"". (bafta = good luck in Romanian)."

The main hero (Sasha) was born with an extraordinary ability: he can protect himself with the extremely sharp sword that is under the skin in his hand. At first glance, he seems to be another stupid superhero from the pointless movie about unreal events and feelings. But it's not about Mechenosets. He can hardly be called an antihero. I think he's just a person who has lost the sense and trust in good, justice and love in their lives. In his life he has never met anyone who could understand and love him (except his mother). Every one of his steps is stained with blood; He takes revenge on everyone for his gift, which became a condemnation to him. And suddenly he meets her.

Whether it really was REALLY intended to reunite the team is uncertain, but it certainly has the look of one of those films. Instead of Fred's usual companions (like Eric Blore or Edward Everett Horton), Burns and Allen are used - probably because, although they're known as a comedy team, they could sing and dance very well. That really shocked me, but the team was a welcome addition and some of the traditional Fred and Ginger numbers were made with either Fred and Gracie or those two along with George. Only at the very end Ms. Fontaine dances with Fred, but it is very short and with a distant camera shot. <br /> <br /> When I talk about Burns and Allen, I think I owe it to the team to talk about it in the movie. I've never been a fan of her show or her movies. In general, I find Gracies Dumbbell Act very annoying and I have given bad reviews on her short films and feature films. But in this movie, I have to admit that they were great - not only competent dancing, I even found them funny and filled the hole left by Edward Everett Horton very nicely. They were at the top of their game and the authors did a wonderful job in this department. <br /> <br /> Well, for the rest of the movie, it's all a lot of fun and entertaining. The problem for me, however, was that Joan Fontaine was not a very good choice for the movie - not just because she performed out of her reach (after all, she was not a singer or dancer), but because she had the screen presence of a lint. For that reason, the usual balance and dialogue between girls and girls was missing. It was also a very charming performance of Harry Watson as a devilish little boy who did everything to play Cupid - all because he wanted to win a bet! And finally, I loved the Fun House and Tunnel of Love sequence - it's too hard to describe, but it's great fun! Overall, I liked the movie pretty much - it had a lot of charm and good writing.

Anyway, here you will notice elements reminiscent of French films, such as long and messy scenes, no or little talking, and of course everyone smokes in French style!

What I really liked was the illustration of immorality / mortality and the obstacles and guidance through life. The film shows a lot of vampire Kei with the power of immorality and the benefits of it. Whether there are supernatural abilities or eternal life is what people usually wish for. Moon Child shows the pains and disadvantages of immortality, as the feelings of loss affect almost all characters, especially the main characters Sho and Kei. The meaning of the title ""Moon Child"" reveals itself as the film comes to an end, where it is clear that everyone is a moon, lighting the path of other people and giving guidance. Personally, I like the moral on which the film is depicted. The film's weaknesses are in some parts of the drama and special effects, as the film became less authentic. The scene in which the character Toshi dies could have been more powerful and realistic if more authentic emotions were included in the drama. Some scenes with special effects, such as the gunshots, could have been more authentic without this being similar to an action video game. The sparks that came out of the guns were too wrong and I think that could have been fixed or fixed. Still, I think Moon Child should be a movie everyone should watch. The symbolic ideas and images produced by the film are easily accepted by everyone and can interest many viewers. It's a pretty pensive movie and entertaining too."

Despite the fact that his friends don't believe him and desperate to help save the colony, Flik volunteers to go out into the world and search for a group of 'warrior' bugs.

7,tt0313162,1,The 74th Annual Academy Awards,"OK, the Oscars seem to be hyped a little more every year. And I wanted to win ""Gosford Park"" to win (well, Robert Altman earned an Oscar for years!). I think it was high time for an African American to win the Best Actress. Unlike the previous critic, Halle Berry's role in ""Monster's Ball"" was far more original than that of Nicole Kidman's ""Moulin Rouge""; I never thought to nominate the latter for anything, especially in a year when ""Mulholland Dr."" Was seen. <br /> <br /> One of the things I predicted was the stuff of the 9/11 attacks. I knew that they would say something about freedom. Yes / Yes. Robert Redford should know better. Unlike the previous reviewer, Whoopi Goldberg is not the worst host (among the previous hosts was Bob Hope, for whom I have no respect). I really liked her jab at John Ashcroft. <br /> <br /> Although I would not have given the best picture to ""A Beautiful Mind,"" the 74th Annual Academy Awards still pleased me (I must admit, I enjoy the Oscars more than on my own birthday the day after my parents and I wandered into the apartments in Bandalier, New Mexico, it was spring break, I thought, when Jim Broadbent won his Oscar, most viewers asked ""Jim, who ?!"" ""I wonder if Woody Allen will ever attend the Oscars again."

8,tt0384036,1,"Parents, children, brothers. A few days in Santiago, Chile, seen by three different characters: Víctor, a schoolboy who develops a crush on a stripper he sees at a club on his birthday; Silvio, Victor's older brother, hired by the club owner to be his driver and who also falls for the woman; and, Gracia, the stripper who's the boss's girlfriend and who wants out. The club owner, Don Pasqual, has many illegal enterprises and a bad heart. Víctor's impulsive puppy love, Silvio's libido, Gracia's plans, and Don Pasqual's possessiveness make for a dangerous mix.","Director and writer Andrés Waissbluth spent seven years completing this two-hour film on the underground crime scene in Santiago de Chile, and perhaps that's one of the reasons why the resulting film has to be episodic and editorial. OR, maybe this is the technique of a director who has a keen sense of film noir storytelling. Two brothers - Silvio the Elder (Néstor Cantillana) and Victor the Younger (Juan Pablo Miranda) - have moved to Santiago from their home in Temuco after the death of their parents and Silvio supports Victor in training. On Victor's seventeenth birthday, Silvio brings the maiden to the clubs, where he encourages Victor to lose his virginity to a stripper / prostitute of the club. In a tender scene, Victor has to face his burgeoning impotence while Silvio is on the club floor, impressing the ""owners"" with his potential for hiring. <br /> <br /> Silvio goes as a bodyguard for the ""gang"" to work / stooges and earns good money to support Victor's education. However, Victor has eyes for one of the dancers of the club Gracia (Antonella Ríos) and starts to woo her. He leaves school and takes Silvio's furious disappointment. Gracia is simply the squeeze of the leader of the club band Don Pascual (Alejandro Trejo), the boss of Silvio! Gracia is the glue that holds this story together, because she is the personality of Victor, Silvio and Don Pascual and the consequences of that bizarre ménage that has a trinity to deadly consequences. By recounting the story through the eyes of Victor, Silvio, and Gracia, we understand the flaws and tears in each character that make possible the demise that results. <br /> <br /> Sounds like a Chilean pulp fiction? Well, it is and is filmed in a brutally colorful, dark way that involves a lot of frontal nudity (both female and male) and provocative sexual encounters. But in the end, it's the sensual aspect of the director's vision that drives this movie, playing successfully on the debut virgin psyche against the die-hard professional sex worker. The cast is pretty strong, especially Antonella Ríos in the demanding role of Gracia. There are enough phrases and repetitions and repetitions of incidents that you think you have understood the first consideration, but whose effects change dramatically when viewed through the eyes of another character. After two hours, a reasonable cut would have improved the effect of the film. In Spanish with English subtitles. Recommended for those who like the trendy movie Noir style and the art of South American cinema. Grady harp"

I often think Belushi is not used enough in Hollywood, and this movie role is one of his best. For those of you who watch his television show, this is a very different and likeable character. The film itself is not earth-shattering, nor is the message new, but rather sweet and lovable.

Ben, Willy Clark's nephew, is the producer of a variety show that wants to feature a reunion of the classic duo. How will Ben convince the crotchety old comedians to put aside their differences before the big show?","The Sunshine Boys are among my favorite movies. It was the first time I saw it as a Christmas attraction at Radio City Music Hall when it first came out and loved it ever since. I've seen it six times in the theaters, and if it had played today, I'd see it again. <br /> <br /> Many of the reviews here mentioned the wonderful performances of the leads. Matthau was brilliant, but was unlucky enough to be nominated for Jack Nicholson's Oscar-winning performance of Randall P. MacMurphy in ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest."" Burns won, though Richard Benjiman had to be nominated at least roles were played perfectly, as Fritz Feld plays for the French fries advertising. <br /> <br /> What brings me to my reason for discussing this movie is directing the much underrated Herbert Ross person play, ""The Owl and the Pussycat"" on the screen and making a full movie out of it, does it again. He opens the games out without making them look like a photographic stage play. He fled the story and the characters. <br /> <br /> Here we are 20 minutes into the movie, before we come to the scene that opens the play where Ben Clark comes to see his uncle and tell him about the comedy special. Although there are dialogues from the play in the first twenty minutes, the sequence itself is completely new. A few years ago I saw on the Broadway Revival of the play with Jack Klugman and Tony Randall, which was wonderful. But I think Ross and the scriptwriter, playwright Simon, have improved it. It's just a wonderful movie."
9,tt0346293,1,"The movie describes the life of Adolf Hitler from childhood to manhood, and how he became so powerful. It describes his poor childhood in Austria, it describes the first world war from his point of view, and how he became the strongest man in Germany. The movie show us how Hitler turned from a poor soldier into the leader of the Nazis, and how he survived the attempts to kill him. It describes his relationship with his mistress Eva Braun, and his decisions and enemies inside Germany and inside the Nazi party.","As someone who was born of a German mother and an English father (who spent five years in a POW camp), I come from a unique position. On the one hand the confrontation with the various Nazis on the one side of the family and the victors of the Second World War on the other side. This miniseries can not immerse themselves in every single part of Hitler's psyche and must give the viewer a general impression of the situation at that time and as much as possible Hitler's state of mind. This series is doing quite well. Carlyle is very good at O'Toole, but I would have liked to get more information about relationships with others in the party because Hitler did not do anything on his own. He had people around him who often followed him without question, and certainly without question later in his murderous career. What went through Goebbels, Goring and Hess's mind? It would have been helpful to see more of these relationships. But I hope that it causes people to explore the subject more. It could also make people understand why someone like Saddam Hussein should not stay in power."

Oh, I was wrong. Totally exaggerated nonsense from start to finish, with both O'Toole and York wildly exaggerating. I have seen it twice and still have no idea what it was about. I have the feeling that O'Toole is playing the laird of a Scottish castle that has a drinking problem and likes to play games with his sister (York). He also barks furiously. But other than that, your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br /> The movie does not have any redeeming function. I can only assume that the cast and the director have been blackmailed to make this bleak, uninspired, prickly puff. Obviously a waste of the time of a talented actor and director. Ridiculous."

This time, the taunting murderer is striking through the sleeping mind of Alice's unborn child. His intention is to be ""born again"" into the real world. The only one who can stop Freddy is his dead mother, but can Alice free her spirit in time to save her own son?","What happened? Those were the first words that came to my mind when that terrible movie appeared on my computer screen for the first and last time. Nightmare on Elm St. had gone noticeably downhill after becoming a cult classic of a first movie, but I doubt anyone expected that dreadful departure. Nobody expected this cosmic joke of a movie, and nobody is more desperate about it than me. <br /> <br /> This is by far the worst movie ever. In the beginning it does not seem to be that bad, with a really scary intro and a rather long shower scene with Alice. But then, at the beginning, we hit a low point with a bad drama and a confusing sequence of events. I mean, sure, Freddy movies are supposed to be gorgeous and scary, but this one is like a train wreck in its bad sequence of events and awful plot construction. It feels like you're coming down with a terrible headache, not that you're scared. So the director fails completely. None of the suspense and well-made horror of previous sequels can be found here, and even the death scenes are mostly crass and moronic (death by food especially), aside from this one cool scene that's shaped like a cartoon fight. That's why this movie gets a point. <br /> <br /> The story ... lame, lame, lame, LAME. It was an excuse for angering people and driving the MPAA crazy, and nothing more. <br /> <br /> The acting ... should I mention how Freddy was turned into a childish boogey-man-like clown figure? How his rebirth scene made him look like a monster from the horror book of a 7-year-old, rather than the gritty and nightmarish dream killer we've all known and loathed since the first film? This arm waves and stutters silently as it reappears ... ugh. And his one liners too. During the whole movie they suck. Bad. A classmate might come up with funnier things, then vomit vomits Freddy throughout the 90 minutes of the movie. Damn, a chimpanzee could bring in much weirder lines than what Freddy said. Who wrote the script for this? This movie is also very irritating. It seems so pointless. Like a mosquito whirling around your head, a mosquito that just will not go away. Freddy is just a nuisance now. We've seen him so many times. This is nothing else, and most of the time you just want him to take his dreadful one-liners and come from your TV screen. Alice, instead of the thoughtful and quiet girl from the last movie, seems to be annoying and very superficial, and this is obviously due to the horrible, terrible screenplay this movie was designed for. Lisa Wilcox may be a great actor, and sometimes it seems that way through the cracks, but she can not save this movie. The other actors are mostly shit. <br /> <br /> The last 15 or 20 minutes of Freddy's existence in this movie are terrible and embarrassing. I hope Englund was ashamed of it. Who wants to see Freddy walking around like a mutated gorilla with outstretched limbs and laughing like a cartoon villain? This movie destroyed everything positive that I felt for the Nightmare series. I can never see her again without this picture going through my mind; from the mutilated horror of the cartoon that became Krueger. He slowly became a jokey, backward pop culture icon, but that's the lowest of the low. That's the low point. No one will ever take Freddy Krueger seriously after watching this movie. He is nothing but a joke, a clown who is long overdue. Pathetic. <br /> <br /> Of all the films I could hate, why did it have to be Nightmare on Elm St, a series I once liked and liked a lot? The Dream Child represents the death of a legend and the breaking of any hope I had in the Nightmare on Elm St. series. Freddy would go on to his downward spiral in clown status in the next episode, Freddy's Dead (which was more entertaining than that, actually), and then he would go on to lower the mood in Freddy VS Jason, and eventually he would lower in nothing break out, which is the best. <br /> <br /> I know that was mostly a rant about why Freddy is shitty now, but this movie is horrible and one of the worst movies ever made. Not recommended for anyone, and even ANOES completers do not want to see this one again."

First of all, I enjoyed the soundtrack (Bryan Adams), it really fits the movie. Second, the simple story, and the drama of Spirit gets your attention. One thing I like the most is that they do not give the stallion a human voice to interact with the other horses, it makes the movie more realistic, not many animations seem realistic now, but ... I do not know, talking animals is just so ... lame. <br /> <br /> One of the nicest animations of 2002 in my opinion, I recommend it to everyone, not just the kids :), because it is very relaxing."
7,tt0017196,1,"Based on the famous novel by Emile Zola. The vivacious and beautiful Nana seeks fame on the stages of Paris in the shows at the Théâtre des Variétés.

She is kept in a sumptuous fashion by a wealthy count, and several prominent and wealthy men find themselves unable to withstand her charms. In the novel, the theater manager describe Nana: ""Nana has something else, dammit, and something that takes the place of everything else. I scented it out, and it smells damnably strong in her, or else I lost my sense of smell."" But there's a pain and a pathos at the heart of Nana's situation, and it slowly makes its poisonous way into the lives of all in Nana's orbit.","When Jean Renoir's first movie ""Whirlpool of Fate"" takes us into the world of the countryside, the rivers, the peasantry, which he will continue to explore, it seems only fitting that his second film be largely with the rich and privileged, the upper ones Classes and those who want to fight their way up. Put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great ""Grand Illusion"" and ""Rules of the Game"". This is beautifully filmed, with the restless camera taking full advantage of the amazingly large apartments and backstage areas that dominate the interior of the movie, and the often-outdated drama also offers some great moments, especially from Werner Krauss's Muffat. But the glamorous and sultry Ms. Hessling, who seems to be giving Louise Brooks a run for her money in vampire-seeking, never goes beyond a monotonous, selfish whoredom. Maybe this is partly a problem with the script, which mostly causes highlights and indignant emotions; If I did not read the novel, I'm not really sure if the decisions were good or not. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the differences between the candidates of Nanas have been good, and I especially liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelos Vandeuvres - the tragic understanding that everyone seems to have of his last fate and sympathy, especially in the scene at the foot of the huge staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat and we wonder if violence will break out - these and other glimpses of the lazy rich ridiculous help to give the movie the depth it has. <br /> <br /> Far from his greatest achievement, and for me probably just the shy overall of ""Whirlpool of Destiny,"" this is still worth seeing for Renoir fans or anyone else interested in silent film."

The adventure, the action, the comedy, the drama ... I thought everything was brilliant. Anderson, Tapping, Shanks, Judge, Davis ... I loved them all. Davis, it seemed, was the fifth most important person in the cast. No big deal. But when his character (General Hammond) disappeared at the end of Season 7 and Anderson's character (Colonel O'Neill) moved from the field to the office, the quality of the series suddenly fell off a cliff. I do not know if it's because Hammond was more important than me or what, but for some reason, after the seventh season, the series became ****. <br /> <br /> The first seven seasons, though, were great. The film Stargate seemed mediocre to me when I saw it for the first time, but it turned out that, even if that was not the original intention, it was a brilliant build of the series. I recommend that you first watch the movie, then watch the first season of the TV series, then watch the movie again (you'll have a whole new appreciation for it the second time, believe me) and then the rest of the TV series , <br /> <br /> The last three seasons of the series are not nearly as good as the first seven, but that does not mean that they are not good. It just means that they are a disappointment if you were spoiled by the first seven seasons. <br /> <br /> After completing this series, be sure to see the spin-off series Stargate: Atlantis. It is a worthy successor to this brilliant series. <br /> <br /> EDIT on 7/18/08: I just heard that Don S. Davis had died a few weeks ago. It's a big loss."

Commander Clint Reed, a doctor with the U.S. Public Health Service, diagnoses a highly contagious disease, pneumonic plague. He tries to convince local officials to find everyone who may have been in contact with the dead man. The Mayor supports his efforts but many, including the police, are doubtful. Reed wants to avoid publicity so as not to panic the public. They have little information to go on - they don't know the dead man's identity - and Reed estimates they have 48 hours before disease begins to spread. With police Capt. Tom Warren going through the motions, Reed sets out to find the killers.","When the movie opens, two thugs kill another criminal. When the body is discovered and soon to be autopsied, the doctor realizes that although the man was shot, he also suffered from the lung plague - a very vicious and malignant version of bubonic plague! So it's a race against time to find those who came into contact with the dead man and treat them immediately, otherwise a disaster could break out. <br /> <br /> Strangely, I know a great deal about the pneumonic plague when I taught a series of lectures on my history lesson. The movie really did not do well to get the facts right because it looked like the people in the movie. The biggest problem is that this disease is so incredibly grotesque that they really did not show it in 1950. Sure, there's a high fever and cough (they got it right), but also a lot of bleeding and explosive vomiting of blackened blood - along with the hugely swollen lymph nodes that you would get with bubonic plague - all pure and disgusting! I can certainly understand why they did not go that far. I am also sure that the federal government has been much more involved in the control and treatment of the disease - here in the film it was treated on a very local level and everyone seemed ill prepared and a bit stupid. Nobody seemed to believe the doctors !! As for acting, the film had some excellent actors here. Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are each the public health doctor and police chief. Good actors but also well-known actors in 1950. In his first film, however, is the very threatening Jack Palance (still under his original nickname ""Walter Jack Palance"") and the relatively unknown (then) Zero Mostel. Palance was great - very scary and physically very skilled in his own stunts. Mostel played a heavy, typical of his early work - a greasy and cowardly kind of evil. <br /> <br /> Overall, the film is very tense, even though it does not sort the details properly and keeps everything a bit too neat and has a great acting - and it is well worth seeing."

Mainly by cinematography, but also by an ingenious score, he creates a chilled and ominous tone that runs throughout the film and gives me goose bumps right from the start. It is really this immaculate ambiance that makes The Shining a masterpiece, as it is in my eyes. Of course, it does not hurt that Jack Nicholson gives one of the greatest performances I've ever seen. A scary authentic depiction of a crazy spirit. Duvall and Lloyd are artificial to be nice, but it's easy to look beyond them when the rest of the movie is so brilliant.

And from that perspective, I can honestly say that, although pleasing, I can see why it has not been aired lately. More precisely, this Mini has some serious problems, such as: <br /> <br /> 1) It's awfully miscast. The actors, who played the younger generation, were every 15 to 20 years older than the characters. Ali McGraw (then 45) played Natalie Jastrow, who was about 26 years old. Jan-Michael Vincent (39 at the time) played Byron Henry, who was about 22 years old. The other Henry children and Pamela Tudsbury were also played by actors far too old for characters to be in their 20s. <br /> <br /> 2) Some of the actors were absolutely terrible. Ali McGraw has sometimes made this mini almost unpredictable. I have seen more convincing performances in high school games. <br /> <br /> 3) The direction was bad. To be fair to Ali McGraw, the bad acting and character development was probably the director. The portrayal of Hitler was exaggerated. His character looked and acted more like a cartoon villain, as the charismatic, sometimes charming, but always devilish genius Herman Wouk painted him as in the novel. Some of the other characters are so stereotyped (Berel Jastrow) that they do not reach the depth of character that Wouk created for them. <br /> <br /> 4) This mini is very old fashioned. The hokey music, the flashy narrative (it sounded like a narrative of the story of junior high school history), and the mini-prime-time-soap-opera feel of the mini sometimes made it almost weird. In addition, Byron and Natalie are too often costumed and made as if they were 1979 instead of 1939. <br /> <br /> Someone who sees this without the benefit of reading the novel first, will probably not stand it all because of it rather than a late 70's / early 80's ""taking myself too seriously"" Prime Time soap drama, rather than the TV version of what is certainly a modern American classic. <br /> <br /> Remakes of older films and the like are sometimes poorly done, but this is probably a case where a creative and inspired director could make a very impressive, memorable and critically acclaimed production. I never see it, because a remake would take as long (15 hours) or more to get it right, and given the short attention span of most current American viewers, it would not fly."

The man undertook his strange journey to mend his relationship with his ill, estranged, 75-year-old brother Lyle.","Maybe more than many movies, this is not for everyone. For some people, the idea of ​​slowing, reflecting, and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell. For others, such an approach speaks to a deep part of themselves that they know exists, to a part they crave. <br /> <br /> I assume that it is a function of where I am in my own life I am counting in the camp of the latter group. I found the meditative speed of this film almost hypnotic and gently led me into an almost mythological realm. This is indeed a journey story, a rich account of the distance many of us have to travel if we want to close the circle at the end of our days. <br /> <br /> As far as Farnsworth's presentation of Alvin was written straight ahead, though I'm not sure if there are words that express the exquisite balance of amused sadness and wise innocence he conjured up for us , Now that he knew he was really arranging his own mortality while sitting on the tractor seat, I wished I had had the opportunity to spend time with him before he left. I hope he had a glimpse of the satisfaction and truth that he had given to so many people, not just for ""acting"" but to share his absolute humanity with such brutal honesty. <br /> <br /> Given the Realities of Production I am not sure if Mr Lynch has developed the story so slowly for the courage he has shown. As an outsider of film production, I understand that there are few areas of modern life in which the term ""time is money"" is so aptly described. To go deep into our hearts is not an adventure that can be rushed, and Mr. Lynch seems to understand that he is not simply telling a story - he invited his viewers to spend some time with their own mortality. Not an easy task, that. <br /> <br /> If you want to experience the power of the movie to introduce yourself to a valuable part of yourself, you could do worse than spend a few hours with The Straight Story , And then give yourself time for the next little play while listening to his echoes at night."

4,tt0412596,0,"The story revolves around Yoko Inoue, a pregnant woman in search for a cafe that's frequented by a Taiwanese composer whose life she is researching.","I am a relative latecomer to the transcendental work of film writer Yasujiro Ozu, whose masterly understated views of Japanese life, especially in the postwar period, illuminate universal truths. After seeing some of his seminal films, such as Late Spring in 1949 and Tokyo Story in 1953, I am convinced that Ozu had a particularly idiosyncratic gift for conveying the range of emotions from intergenerational conflicts through elliptical narratives and subtle imagery. It is the wish of Taiwanese director Hou Hsiao-hsien to honor Ozu on this centenary of his birth with this generally amusing 2003 film. Under the co-script writer T'ien-wen Chu, Hsiao-hsien seems to be doing the visuals right, but does not capture the necessary emotional weight that would have made the glacial stimulation bearable. <br /> <br /> The story is about Yôko, a young Japanese writer who explored the life of 20th-century Taiwanese composer Jiang Wen-Ye in Tokyo after she returned from Taiwan where she had taught Japanese , After 25 minutes of character-drawing, she reveals to her father and step-mother that she is pregnant by one of her students in Taiwan. At the same time, Yôko's coffee shop friend Hajime, who runs a used bookstore, has an obsession with trains and seems to be in love with her. Hsiao-hsien combines this thin storyline with a series of shots that are considered unusually long takes as the frame composition changes. There are also long stretches of silence as well as a wealth of scenes with trains. While these techniques are in line with Ozu's style, Hsiao-hsien can not plunge into the psyche of the characters, as Ozu did with maximum fluidity and minimal theatricality; in particular, Yôko's plight in the scheme of the drama presented seems rather noncommittal to her parents' reaction excessively passive, to have great interest. In fact, the whole movie has an atmosphere of exhaustion that makes the movie seem infinite. <br /> <br /> The performances are unobtrusive but hardly memorable. J-pop music star Yo Hitoto brings a natural lightness to Yôko, while Tadanobu Asano is a kind of cipher like Hajime. The rest of the characters are barely registered, even Nenji Kobayashi and Kimiko Yo as Yôko's parents. Cinematographer Lee Ping-Bing offers expert work, although he violates a basic rule of Ozu films by keeping the camera unstable during the shoot. Hitoto speaks - sings the groovy pop song, which is used in the credits ""Hito-Shian"". The DVD features a one-hour documentary produced in France, ""Métro Lumière"", which in fact contributes to providing part of the context for Hsiao-hsien's approach to the film. It contains excerpts from Ozu's films, especially ""Equinox Flower,"" to show the parallels to this film, though surprisingly no mention of ""Tokyo Story"" or ""Early Summer,"" the obvious basis for some scenes and situations, was found. UPS. There are also edited interview clips from Hitoto, Asano and Hsiao-hsien, as well as the trailer of the film."

CCCC has had much controversy over the financing of the film and, without really knowing what the movie is about, has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film in India and abroad. The only information was that it was a thriller. The movie was released in 2001 and the movie was surprisingly good. The main plot has to do with surrogacy and is well managed. Salman and Preiti perform well, though Salman does not actually take off a shirt. Must be special effects !! Rani plays Salman's wife, but it's a slightly less demanding role compared to Preiti, who plays prostitute, who eventually becomes the surrogate mother. The three main features confirm that Har Di Jo Pyar Karega has a solid screen and off-screen chemistry (apparently). Salman Khan, who is excellent, plays a serious role in the film as a successful businessman and is a pity that he is being exploited as a would-be comedian in his other films, as he is partially underestimated in the Mumbai film industry, partly because of the films he does chooses. Rani's character does not know that Preiti is a prostitute until the very end ... she kept that from her and the rest of the family ... the rest you should find out as it will ruin the movie if I tell you. The songs are all well portrayed, especially the Decon Walon and the theme song. The other supporting actors make a minimal but fine effort as Salman's loving family.

The second half of the movie picks up as soon as we begin to examine the forgotten gadgets of the ""Krell"".

Only a cheeky, humorless idiot would not enjoy this wonderful movie. This movie feels like a piece of warm apple pie with French vanilla ice cream! I think that's Cher's best work of all time and her most credible performance. Cher has always been blessed with charisma, good looks and an enviably thin figure. Whether you like singing or not, who else sounds like Cher? Cher has definitely made a name for herself in the entertainment industry and will be remembered long after others come and go. She is one of the most unique artists out there. It's funny, because who would have considered Cher as such a naturally gifted actress? She is the head of the so-called movie ""Stars"" of today. Cher is a real actor on the same level as Debra Winger, Alfre Woodard, Holly Hunter, Angela Bassett and a few others, as she never seems ""acting"", she becomes really convincing. She has more than earned the respect of her colleagues and the movie-going public. <br /> <br /> Everything about Moonstruck is wonderful - the characters, the scenery, the dialogue, the food. I never get tired of watching this movie. <br /> <br /> Every time I look at the scene where everyone is sitting at the dining table of Rose's house, I pause to see exactly what delicious food Rose's serving is. I saw the spaghetti, mushrooms (I think), but I can not tell if they eat ravioli, Ziti? What is the main course? It looks wonderful and it drives me crazy! <br /> <br /> Everyone in this family was a hard working person and they respected and cared for each other. The grandfather was not marginalized and tolerated, he was an important part of the family and he was listened to and respected for his age and wisdom. He seemed like a pretty healthy, independent old guy. <br /> <br /> Loretta's mother was not ""just a housewife"", she was the glue that kept the family together and was a prime example of what a wife, mother and home director should aim to be. She was proud of the lifestyle she had chosen, but she did not define who she was. High-powered business people are not as comfortable in their skin as Rose Casterini was. Notice the naughty way she said, ""I had no kids until I was 37. It's not over yet."" They felt that she had been the kind of young woman who had done exactly what she wanted and got through without the other person noticing what had happened. She was charming, quick-witted and very smart. What a great mother! <br /> <br /> Actually, I did not really like Loretta, because she seemed a bit of a know-it-all, who was not really as adventurous and self-possessed as she wanted others to think. She could tell others about herself and where they had gone wrong, but she did not use common sense in her own life. She wanted to marry a middle-aged boy just because she wanted a husband and a sense of identity and purpose in her life. She was more conventional than her own mother. She got dressed and wore her hair like a matron in a detention center and seemed humorless and bored, but under that they felt that she was vulnerable and lonely and had much love to give the right man. She would probably be a great mother, too. <br /> <br /> I could see a house full of Loretta and Ronnie's screaming happy children in the future and Rose and Cosmo enjoy every minute of it."

This movie sucks, it's good or just funny. The third is probably the best way to explain this movie. It has weird themes and just a strange plot. So, who else but Christopher Walken would play in it, no matter how bad, average or even how good it might be. <br /> <br /> The acting was what you would expect especially from Ben Stiller. Jack Black I've always liked it, so you know what you get from it, but that's not bad. Christopher Walken is always off the wall. He's always fun no matter how bad the movie is. Funny it is a bit strange. Of course, that means it has its moments (albeit very few), but here and there it can be exaggerated a bit, which makes me feel that the movie is just desperate for laughter, but of course not in a good way br /> <br /> The direction was also average. Barry Levinson is a slightly overrated director and has not really done a good job here. This movie seemed to have a lot more potential and he did not do much to reach him. Only very average and it did not seem like you put a lot of effort into the movie. <br /> <br /> Writing is the key to a good comedy. Obviously this means that the letter failed here. In the best case, it is below average. Considering that it has its moments, it was not too terrible. However, this is never a good thing to say about a movie. <br /> <br /> If it were not Christopher Walken and the silly ridiculous ending, I would have given him a lower rating. He is always a character in his films. Style is a crazy movie with strange characters that go nowhere. Not terrible, but I would not really recommend it because it's a very forgetful movie."

The problem is that this murderer is not so mysterious, because she's as distinctive as Harry.

Whilst on the run from military which seeks his capture, Banner comes close to a cure. But all is lost when a new creature emerges; The Abomination.","This restart is like a processed McDonald's meal compared to Ang Lee's very good but very underrated 2003 ""The Incredible Hulk"". <br /> <br /> Ang Lee's ""The Hulk"" is a comic book movie for the thinking person. The Hulk takes some time to appear (about 40 minutes), but when he does that, we see the conflict at the core of our protagonist. He does his best not to lose control, but as he admits, when he gives in to his anger, he likes it. <br /> <br /> Now compare this to Edward Norton, who shows no conflict in his personality, and he turns into hulk when he gets aroused and his pulse rate reaches 200 beats per minute (not 183, not 197) but exactly 200). This reviewer resembled the introduction of Midichloriern in The Phantom Menace, which show how strong the ""power"" is at one, as if mystical abilities could be measured by a blood test. In the 2008 film, Bruce Banner of Ed Norton only has to keep his pulse below 200, as a device holds on to his wrist. And for the record, it's extremely difficult to get your pulse rate up to 200 even through a very exciting run, especially for a physically fit person. <br /> <br /> Emotions drive Eric Bana's Hulk. He has repressed memories of his mother's death and his father's role in his early life. He is calm on the surface, but there is great anger in there, enough anger to fuel the Hulk when unleashed. But the Hulk never deliberately kills, not even its attackers. Mostly he just wants to get away or be close to Betty Ross (Jennifer Connelly). He makes his shooters incapacitated and rescues in a critical scene a fighter jet, which pursues him from a collision. <br /> <br /> In the movie 2003, the visual effects are present, but as needed. The action scenes (and there are plenty of them) are necessary for the storyline, unlike the movie from 2008, which uses action action. <br /> <br /> In his quest to turn it into a ""refugee"". History, Ed Norton loses focus on how Bruce Banner feels about the hulk. For him, the hulk is a dangerous side effect of an experiment that went awry. And Louis Leterrier, the director who deals with Ed Norton's keyword, adds no emotional dimension to the Banner-Hulk relationship. The story can be summarized as follows: Banner is tracked and Hulk beats the butt, Banner is flattened and Hulk steps. Repeat as needed. <br /> <br /> The only thing that went against the film in 2003 is that it may not be as faithful to the comics as the 2008 version. But even if I'm a fan of the comics, I'd prefer a movie who is not as comics-wise as a fan-boy's dream, but he has a heart every day over the comics-loyal, but crafted and soulless version of 2008. <br /> <br /> Maybe Ang Lee might have read more comics should. Iron Man, also released in 2008, is a perfect example of a movie that is true to its comic roots and has a heart."

It delivered in a fascinating way a good introduction to the figure and its background. <br /> <br /> Although it has some action-flick elements, it is much more of an intimate game, excellently written. Unfortunately, this is also where a major disadvantage of the film is revealed. An intimate game thrives on the skills of its performers and has unfortunately delivered only half of the performers. While Alexandra Staden did an excellent job as Modesty Blaise, her opponent Nikolaj Coaster-Waldau - as the villain Miklos - did not. As he threaded his way through the plot as if it were an extended toothpaste, he failed to build an atmosphere of fear that would make the movie a masterpiece.

First, I'd like to say that I think even ""Silent Night Part 2"" is better than that (that was filled with flashbacks of the original for more than half of the movie). ""Christmas Evil"" tries to become psychological by introducing the main character as insane (a strong word), slowly (very slowly). He is irritated by people who do not have the true meaning of Christmas and at work he can not stand how the fabricated toys are made with such a lack of quality and love. Disguised as Santa, he finally goes on a rampage. Also a strong word, as only 3 people are killed without special effects really needed. No tension, no thrill, no blood, no plaster. For one exception, Jeffrey DeMunn is in it. He is best known for playing Tom Hanks as one of the guardians in the classic ""The Green Mile"". He still has to beat himself to accept the role. He is really the only one who can really act, his supporting role is better than the main one. (Who is not so bad, but if you are overshadowed by a small supporter, you are not great either.). And what about this strange ending? (You have to see it to believe it). ""Christmas Evil"" is downright boring, nothing happens and the artwork is simply misleading. This is not a slasher.

That's fair (after all, that's how it was most prevalent), but after seeing the ""Final Justice"" in its original form, I just wanted to share a few thoughts and comments on the Uncut version. <br /> <br /> First of all, we have to admit that the original version is a bit more coherent than the MST3K program, mainly due to an expository scene between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (I could use the names of the characters) instead of the actors, but I just like to type the words ""Venantino Venantini"" and explain why Venantini's fleeting character can not just leave Malta. (It's not a very convincing storyline, but at least the filmmakers have tried to talk about it.) Whether this scene was cut just for the time or because it did not provide much food for riffs, I do not know. <br /> <br /> Another storyline is missing in the original: The in the MST3K version apparently unmotivated betrayal of Venantino Venantini to Joe Don Baker on the stripper explains itself from an earlier, extremely unpleasant scene in which Venantini under the Shower raped. While that gives her a motive to turn against him, the whole scenario is just really ... disgusting. (There's no other word for it.) <br /> <br /> Some of the MST-worthy moments (the ever-cut-off calls of ""Son of a--"" and the ""Deja-vu"" shoot of the sheriff) were pure The result of the edited TV print with which they worked and which did not appear in the original film. <br /> <br /> One scene I wish had made it into the MST3K version: Before entering the bar to interview some people, Joe Don asks the Maltese policewoman to accompany him, to stay outside because ""they see this uniform, they will not cooperate."" However, Joe Don wears his ridiculous cowboy slash sheriff outfit, complete with a shiny badge! I can not imagine why they gave this great opportunity to make fun of him ... <br /> <br /> One final comment on the original, uncut version of ""Final Justice"": Why, oh, why ? the feeling of putting Venantino Venantinis naked butt on the screen?"

This was the perfect way to start a story, and in most cases it's unpredictable, and the double-twist ending is shocking and pretty scary! Class A <br /> <br /> 2. History. (""Wax figures""). It's a solid story, with wonderful performances, but the end is pretty predictable, but it's still scary and pretty exciting, Peter Cushing did a great job, and I could not believe how young Joss Ackland was really enjoyed this story! Class B <br /> <br /> 3. History (""Sweets to the Sweet""). This is the best story here, as it is extremely scary and unpredictable, it also has a nice twist! Christopher Lee did a great job, and Chloe Franks did a wonderful job as a young daughter, and the end is pretty shocking! I do not want to ruin it for you, but it's one of the best horror stories I've seen! Class A + <br /> <br /> 4. History (""The Cape""). This is a terrible story that is really weak and unconventional.

Class D <br /> <br /> The direction is great!. Peter Duffell does a great job here, with ingenious camera work, great angles, a spooky atmosphere, and keeps the movie at a very fast pace! <br /> <br /> The Acting is awesome!. John Bryans is great here, as a narrator, he had some great lines, I just wish he had more screen time. John Bennett is very good as Det., And was pretty intense, he was especially good in the end! I really liked him. Denholm Elliott is excellent like Charles, he was vulnerable, showed fear, was very personable and I loved his facial expressions, he rocked! Joanna Dunham is amazingly beautiful! And did great with what she had to do as a wife, she also had a great chemistry with Denholm Elliott! Tom Adams is scary as Dominic, he looked scary and did the job extremely well! Peter Cushing is fantastic as always, and is amazing here, he is personable, focused, charming and, as always, has a lot of class! (Cushing rules !!). Joss Ackland is fantastic as ever and looked so young here, I barely recognized him, his accent was not so thick and played a different role, I loved it! (Ackland rules). Wolfe Morris is scary here and did what he had to do well. Christopher Lee is amazing as always and is incredible here, he is incredibly intense, very focused and as always he had that great, intense look on his face, he was especially amazing in the end! (Lee rules !!). Chloe Franks is adorable like the daughter, she is a bit scary, and gave one of the best children's performances I've ever seen !, I loved her. Nyree Dawn Porter is beautiful and was excellent as a babysitter, I liked her a lot! Jon Pertwee annoyed me here, and was pretty boring, and completely ignorant, he had no chemistry with Ingrid Pitt! Ingrid Pitt is beautiful and does her usual vampire thing and does it well! <br /> <br /> Rest of the cast is fine. Overall a must! **** of 5"

Look 12/6/2009 - 4 out of 10 (Dir-Walter Lang): Disappointing musical from the perspective of character development, from my point of view, from this much-vaunted Rodgers and Hammerstein piece. There are some good songs and a decent comic performance of Yul Brynner's King of Siam - but the movie is not really good at presenting the situation and settings. I can only blame the script and possibly the acting, why we do not fully understand the characters and their situations. I know that maybe it would be a bit too much to ask for a musical intended for the enjoyment of the songs and the dance, but even that part did not strike me. The basic story is about an Englishwoman who comes to Siam to teach the children about fine European things. We later find out that the king is actually the greatest student. There is a side ban romance between the king's latest wife, played by Rita Moreno (a Latino as an Arab - come on !!) and a former lover who caused some complications but added nothing really intriguing. Deborah Kerr, as the main character Annie - is fine, but not so convincing. The king learns some things because of their presence and then the movie fades like him. This is really a tiny story with some songs and dances, but not really great for a spectator."

While it was a simple rivalry between two brothers, it was not just hate or jealousy. What I liked most about the film was how I identified with the feelings Gigi was going through, especially if he had to take his mother to her hometown in Italy and failed to attend the film festival. Seeing this character, who fought so hard between his artistic dream and his innate sense of duty to his mother, was so frustrating. Even at the end, when he tried to reach his father again, he was so brave. And as in real life, most fathers can never overcome their walls to reach their children. I even identified with Giancarlo, the brother who, while he was the more confident and older brother, had so many insecurities. A really nice movie that made me laugh and cry."

The harder you think about the movie, the worse it gets, unless you have a contest to discover the most plot gaps. In this case you have hours of entertainment in front of you. I would recommend this movie only to the bored or die-hard Smap fans.

The acting was not bad, even if only a few too many eyebrows were pulled up by Farrell. Honestly, I can not believe how little I was interested in any character in this movie. Situations are played out on the screen in an empty sequence of nothingness. Donald Sutherland's part consists of a few scenes in which he opens a door, says something and closes it again. I looked at my watch when I did not duck over the dialogue on the screen. I never went out in a movie, but I was tempted to start with it. I've given this movie a score of '2' for reasons that seem horrendously shallow to me, but those are the best things I can say about this movie.

And listen to Badalamenti's score and the main theme that truly invigorates the landscapes of Iowa and Wisconsin that are frequently shown. <br /> <br /> Farnsworth plays one of his finest in this film, making him one of the most likeable men ever to be shown on film. He does not have to say anything to express his feelings and thoughts. His cheerfulness shines through him and his acting earned him an Oscar nomination. Do I have to say that his weak health was not played in this movie? He was diagnosed with cancer and shot himself right after this movie was done. This knowledge only pays more attention to the movie because it is rather a tribute to Farnsworth. <br /> <br /> All the above make a very nice movie suitable for all kinds of people who like a movie the way it should be made. You might ask for homilies that are not so obvious and a bit naïve, but it does not ruin the overall picture, as it's a memorable movie. 10.9."

In the 1800s, a boy becomes a man when he ventures through the breach in pursuit of a fallen star, to prove his love for the village beauty. The star is no lump of rock, it's a maiden, Yvaine. Tristan, the youth, is not the only one looking for her: three witches, led by Lamia, want her heart to make them young; and, the sons of the dead king of Stormhold want her because she holds a ruby that will give one of them title to the throne. Assisting Tristan are his mother, the victim of a spell, and a cross-dressing pirate of the skies. Will Tristan win his true love?","When I saw this movie, I was a bit skeptical because fantasy movies are not always my cup of tea. Especially a romantic fantasy. <br /> <br /> I did not know that I would go through cinematic magic. Everything in the film from action to dialogue to effects was very close to perfection. <br /> <br /> Claire Danes seems like the star she is in this movie. From start to finish you fall more and more in love with this figure. <br /> <br /> Michelle Pfeiffer is threatening as a wicked witch who wants to conquer the star for eternal youth and beauty. <br /> <br /> Robert De Niro is a loveable character who gives the audience the greatest bit of weird relief as the movie climaxes. Overall, this was a movie that surprised and delighted me as a movie fan. If you are looking for a fun and entertaining movie that is fun for both children and adults, Stardust is the way to go."

Its safety is in doubt as many criminals want the crown -- an international pair of criminals, a San Francisco gangster and his cohorts, and a super criminal known as Metaxa. Mr. Moto is forced to postpone his vacation while he deals with the threat.","I generally love those 1930s movies that come from Mystery / Police Charlie Chan, and that's no exception. However, something with this movie seems to be bad. A later attempt to switch from cerebral moto-films revolving around the storyline to a salad bar pampered by comic relief as relieving as sore feet. A Typecast buffoon appears out of nowhere and incarnates a clumsy Englishman playing the detective, and even other characters seem to get involved in the comedy. The action may seem odd today or a mere apology for us, but at that time the possibility of epochal archaeological discoveries was not only real, but a common occurrence."

There is not much to recommend. I found it very slow, tedious, indeed. It's pretty predictable, too. The numbers one and two were predictable, but not so much. I also found that this film was sometimes quite squeamish, which I did not really consider this series and the character. Jeff Fahey plays the main evil in this episode. He is a decent actor, but I felt that he also played his character exaggeratedly. I suppose that matched the tone of the movie, which would have been great if I liked the movie. There were also some pretty bad one-liners. Arnold Vosloo returns in the title role, but there is little work in this film. The character has not really evolved, as I had hoped. Well, that's just my opinion. For me, while this movie is not abysmal, it's pretty bad. My voice for Darkman III: 3.5 / 5"

I had been waiting for this movie to come out for years, and I was a staunch supporter of Chaos Comics until they went bankrupt. Not only did they cut half of the story, they also changed the information. The statement that Lucifer is the father of hope is untrue. He has corrupted her father, but he himself is not her father. Nor did the voices match the characters, and once you hear the voice of a beloved character, the voice you heard in your head can never be returned.

(B-pictures were low-budget pictures made quickly with low budgets and no big stars). It's only as long as it needs to be (just 65 minutes), is well-directed, fast-paced and exciting. It only stumbles at the end, which I found a little too implausible to buy it. <br /> <br /> Foch (a good actress) is only OK in the lead, but Lady May Witty is great and George Macready is excellent (and scary) like the villains.

Soon the discussion gets around to their favorite sexual fantasies","Although Cameron Grant was clearly destined to replace Andrew Blake at Ultimate Pictures when he set up his own company (Studio A), he outperformed the ""master"" right outside the gate when it came to building steaming sex scenes. So, while all the window dressing Blake had done pioneering (starlets in fetish lingerie and sunglasses, hairdressed and made-up as if they're just before the catwalk) remained very present and accounted for, Grant added his own personal twist of carnal content. He raised the heat to a level that Big A has since his first ?? and IMHO best ?? Movie night rides. Came's first effort, ELEMENTS OF DESIRE, might have been hampered by too slavish leaning on the Blake aesthetic (with an excess of girl-on-girl pats), but his ensuing DINNER PARTY already shows him at the top of his mold in what must certainly be titles as his masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The title spells the premise as a group of doing well, friends and acquaintances gather at dinner to exchange sexy stories, with an extended orgy at the end. Scrumptious July Ashton and Tammy Parks are smeared across the flawless bodies of others in their kitchen sequence, which will surely please those who want to combine palate pleasures with those of the flesh. Busty Crystal Gold (here: ""Catalina"") was rarely more than a reliable second stringer, spicing up some of Kelly Noir's ona Zee bargains, but looking absolutely stunning in a romantic poster featuring Fabio Lookalike Vince Voyeur. The beautiful blondes Kylie Ireland and Yvonne, who make out with Marc Davis (for the recording, the last two were an object at that time) under a waterfall, complete the eye candy section of the film. <br /> <br /> Time to cook! The early Jenna Jameson (""Daisy"" then) is a harbinger of greatness that derives Frank Towers (""Mark Slade"" on his later switch to the gay side of the industry) from all the vital juices, albeit with the help of the brunette Diva Für The stylish industrial environment of the scene provides an impressive background for the sex that is taking place right now. Incredibly hunky construction worker Gerry Pike tries to cool down on a muggy summer's day by spraying down, a prospect tempting to prime 'real business woman Asia Carrera (to her at all painfully pretty) to go. Best of Show must be the imaginative sequence in which the nasty Norma Jeane and the handsome Sean Michaels tear each other's pants off ?? for starters! ?? while separated by a glass partition until the predictably sparkling conclusion. <br /> <br /> With sex proving either artistic or hot, and more often than both, Grant has concocted a veritable smörgåsbord of meaty goods to continue the film's gastronomic analogy of titles. Couples may be the main target group, but a change between Naughty 'n' Nice should rightly include the ""something for all"" recipe that many adult features target. The director, who acts as his own cameraman, shows great attention to detail, such as the inclusion of Asian Carrera's immaculate white shoes spattered with mud and enriching his vision. This marks him as a great filmmaker rather than a mere usable movie, as was the case with Nick Steele, who took his place at Ultimate? effectively make him a substitute? ?? when he packed up for greener pastures."

People tend to miss the power of the movie, which contains the infamous Nerve Saw scene. <br /> <br /> Deliverance, action, cinematography and the soundtrack of Deliverance all contribute to its brooding charisma. The backcountry in which it was filmed is beautiful and quite in contrast to the dark theme. The actors, both primary and minor, make you feel like you are going downriver with them directly. <br /> <br /> What separates this film from others is the tangible sense of fear it inspires.

It was eerie to see Will Ferrell become Woody. But I do not think that imaginative casting is enough. One should wait until they have a story before making a movie.

I may have seen 30 minutes of this movie and had to turn it off. I am not sure if I can take much more. On a superficial level, the wrong accents, as others have said, are at best simply distracting and at worst irritating and vague. The drama is boring when it should be passionate and funny, if it should be serious. The portrayal of Lou Salome is just superficial, and the brilliant Freud is little more than a schoolboy.

""The Night Listener"" is one of his best works despite his mediocre reviews and a quick DVD release. <br /> <br /> This is a very frightening story, though it does not include a serial killer or anyone that is physically dangerous in that regard.

I was touched by the story until I read reports online that Johnson may not even exist. When I saw this movie, the confused feelings that Robin Williams portrayed so brilliantly reappeared in my mind. <br /> <br /> Toni Collette probably also gives her best dramatic portrayal as the ultimately sociopathic ""janitor"". Her role was far removed from those she had in films like ""Little Miss Sunshine"". There were even times when she looked at the camera, where I thought she was staring directly at me. It takes a good actress to play this kind of role, and it is this understated (but well reviewed) role that makes Toni Collette one of the best actresses of this generation not even nominated for an Oscar (as of 2008) ). , It is unbelievable that there is at least one woman in this world that is, and it is also scary. <br /> <br /> This is a good, dark movie that I highly recommend.

The film breathes, stays in the moment, lives in real time. The story is told. For a change, the medium and its artifacts are not the message. The film unerringly and truthfully conveys the childhood perspective of its characters; it does not impose its adult meanings or morals. Details arise from their own, are never crowded and therefore seem all the more real and powerful for their understatement. Although much effort has been made to capture the authentic social reality of Crown Heights, part of the largest black ghetto in New York City and one of the most dangerous violent places in the US, childhood is in the ghetto, not the ghetto itself br /> <br /> Documentary footage of the practice sessions of a marching band, the Jackie Robinson Steppers, punctuates the film at regular intervals with an explosion of color, movement and sound. Otherwise, the camera remains very close, very intimate, a patient, smart and unobtrusive observer. The language is rich, spontaneous, the spectacle transparent. Some scenes stand out, like the loitering girls, each revealing their deepest fantasies. Lanisha's admission of her acceptance of a death by arbitrary force is the most shocking, one of the deepest scars of the ghetto. She shares with her mother her confusion and fear of the harsh challenges of adult life and is equally moving and beautiful, unsentimentally affirmative. <br /> <br /> Social realities are respected, not propagated: All three girls are brought up alone Mothers, only one, Lanisha, has a father active in her life (and not by chance of the three she is the most emotionally stable and empathic too) others, and the one with the greatest self esteem). Two of them suffer from asthma, a condition that is disproportionately common in the city center. Shots, an everyday event, only briefly interrupt their conversation. Only one of the girls, Joy, feels hope, feels that she has control over the future, while the other two have accepted despair to varying degrees. <br /> <br /> This is by far the best dramatic American movie I have seen in years. See it, see it, see it."

Sure, they deserve better things than what they had before. <br /> <br /> But honestly, the things Ty Pennington and his crew put into these homes are enough to fit a whole neighborhood. <br /> <br /> Another thing that really annoys me about this show is how Ty and his crew always have something good to say about every little thing that relates to the family or the condition of the family. To tell a wheelchair user that he is ""so strong"" or ""very brave"" becomes really old after a while. That may sound rude, but believe me; Look at this show and you'll see what I mean. <br /> <br /> All in all, this show is overrated. If you want to see it, go on.

He is a girl in naughty books! Was this done to make the movie attractive to boys? My goodness. And where was Pewter, the gray cat? One of the funniest characters in the book is missing in this mess. Rita Mae Brown is a good writer, but leaving Disney behind in her work was wrong. An animated feature film, perhaps in the wings of Don Bluth's artwork, would suit a better Mrs. Murphy movie.

The characters make an unlikely bright dialogue, but never appear in any way as human recognizable. An arbitrary, meaningless act follows another to continue what is a conspiracy, and one soon becomes tired of the falseness of the whole enterprise. <br /> <br /> Andie MacDowell gets points for playing her little heart, but the performing honors are stolen by Imelda Staunton from a police detective (they have no height over there?). Mrs. Staunton seems unable to make a wrong move. Could we have said the same thing about the author and the director? If Notting Hill has upset you, stay away from it.

After years of playing a wide range of parts, he can not remember who he is - who are his roles and who is the self.

Ultimately, it takes him to the depths of madness and murder. <br /> <br /> I saw this movie years ago and I liked it. I just saw it again and loved it. Well, maybe my enthusiasm is because I've always loved Ronald Colman and that's a big triumph for him - and for which he won the Oscar for Best Actor. And given the competition this year (Gregory Peck for GENTLEMANS AGREEMENT, John Garfield for BODY AND SOUL, William Powell for LIFE WITH FATHER, and Michael Redgrave for MOURNING BECOMES ELECTRA), Colman was a very good choice of his usual comfort zone and played a much more sophisticated role , <br /> <br /> Now I noticed that a reviewer hated this movie because they hated Shakespeare - and that took about half of their review to talk about their dislike of him. But this movie is not really about Shakespeare, and it does not matter if you do not like Shakespeare. I'm not a big fan of Shakespeare, but I'm amazed at the small parts of the play that Colman has reenacted - though, as I said, this is not a Shakespeare movie. Instead, it's a wonderful portrait of an actor losing his mind and mixing his stage role with reality. It could have been EVERY game, though ""Othello"" was an excellent choice for the murder scene - which is later played out in the movie. <br /> <br /> Overall a very clever movie because of a nice script - with some undertones of Film Noir. Fortunately, the show was also terrific as Colman had excellent support from Signe Hasso, Shelly Winters and Edmond O'Brien (which was especially good - he played his part just right).

In an interview with ""Fangoria"" in 1987, Eisley recalled that Herbert Strock had directed most of the film, but somehow Kenneth Hartford - who only staged the material with his children Andrea and Glenn - invented full credit. Given how awful the end result was, Strock was probably glad he had not been credited! ""Monster"" has the look and character of a mid-70s TV movie, so I keep it in the background again and again.

10,tt0073076,1,"The Maysles brothers pay visits to Edith Bouvier Beale, nearing 80, and her daughter Edie. Reclusive, the pair live with cats and raccoons in Grey Gardens, a crumbling mansion in East Hampton. Edith is dry and quick-witted - a singer, married but later separated, a member of high society. Edie is voluble, dresses - as she puts it - for combat in tight ensembles that include scarves wrapped around her head. There are hints that Edie came home 24 years before to be cared for rather than to care for her mother. The women address the camera, talking over each other, moving from the present to events years before. They're odd, with flinty affection for each other.","One question that must be asked immediately is: Would this movie have been made if the women were not the aunt and cousin of Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy Onassis? <br /> <br /> The answer is: Probably not /> <br /> But luckily they are (or were) the cousin and aunt of Jackie. <br /> <br /> This documentary film by the Maysles Brothers about the existence (you could hardly call it a life) by Edith B. Beale, Jr., and her daughter Edith Bouvier Beale (Edie) has the same allure of a train accident - You do not want to look, but you have to. <br /> <br /> Big Edith and Little Edie live in a once magnificent villa in East Hampton, New York, which slowly decays around them. The once beautiful gardens are now a jungle. <br /> <br /> Magnificent oil paintings lean against the wall (with cat feces on the floor behind them) and beautiful portraits of them as young women vying for room on the walls next to covers of old magazines. <br /> <br /> Living alone for many years has cut many barriers between the two women but has built others. <br /> <br /> Clothes seem to be optional. Edie's favorite costume is a pair of shorts with tights pulled over them and a few pieces of cloth wrapped around her torso and head. <br /> <br /> As Edith says, ""Edie is still beautiful at the age of 56 years."" And she is too. There are times when it almost shines and both women show the beauty that was once there. <br /> <br /> There is a constant undercurrent of sexual tension. <br /> <br /> Your eating habits are (to be polite) strange. Ice cream distributed on crackers. A dinner party for Edith's Wonder Bread Sandwiches birthday, served on fine china with plastic dishes. <br /> <br /> Time is irrelevant in their world; as Edie says, ""I have no clocks."" <br /> <br /> Your relationships with men are so strange. <br /> <br /> Edie feels that Edith has thwarted any of her attempts. She says, ""If you do not get a man to make you an application, you might as well be dead."" Edith replies, ""I'll take a dog every day."" It is obvious that Edith does not see her role in Edie's lack of male camaraderie. At the beginning of the film, she says, ""France has fallen, but Edie is not. <br /> <br /> Sometimes it's difficult to hear exactly what's said, both women talk at the same time and keep contradicting each other."" There is a strange relationship with animals during the movie, Edie feeds the raccoons in the loft with Wonder Bread and cat food. The cats (and there are many of them) are everywhere. <br /> <BR /> At one point, Edie explains, ""The mark of the aristocracy is responsibility."" But they do not seem to be able to take responsibility for themselves. <br /> <br /> This is a difficult movie to see, but worth the effort."

During that year, Augusten avoids school, keeps a journal, and practices cosmetology. His mother's mental illness worsens, he takes an older lover, he finds friendship with Finch's younger daughter, and he's the occasional recipient of gifts from an unlikely benefactor. Can he survive to come of age?","To create a cinematic audience - I am certainly amazed at the many positive comments this wretched film has collected here. I can not approve, I can not help but be suspicious when it comes to rewarding back alleys for critics who praise Annette Bening for an Oscar; the hole in the kitchen ceiling could more fittingly be attributed to their chewing landscape. She is a wonderful actress, but this is an unfortunately unbalanced notion that requires filmmakers of essential quality to be able to capture the rhythm of the script and maintain it for the duration of the disconnected madness that is a movie shoot. <br /> <br /> I do not really want to blame Miss Bening or most of the other performers (well, Gwyneth Paltrow has no excuse for her spongy work), because this is a horrendous adaptation, a classic case of mistranslation (me I'm prepared for that) suppose I did not read the book and I do not think I'll do that afterwards). The script puts us in the midst / clutter of inexplicable behavior and extreme emotional fear emanating from mystifying characters who have not developed with us or with other relationships. It quickly becomes a grotesquely exaggerated tsunami-like robbery that baffles characters and audiences alike, leaving me like a survivor shaking his head at the end of each repetitive episode. Shock and awe would describe my response to hectic, bipolar mood swings between the murmuring and the oh-so-subtle sensibilities telegraphed by one of the most irritating, manipulative, booming soundtracks I've heard - all this is not put on ridiculously inappropriate toons - Time witness, you know, but chosen with an astonishing disregard for the tone of the scenes. <br /> <br /> How this good cast mingled with it, I'm not mistaken you know - I can not believe they saw the script before signing. They use their skills with devotion - I was so sorry for the wonderful Jill Clayburgh, who was saddled with a cartoon bag lady costume and a wig that tried in vain to rip out something meaningful from fleeting and clichéd dialogues. In contrast, Alec Baldwin somehow rises above the material to deliver consistent, nuanced, real performance. Can someone please give this man a major role of substance? And what about Rachel Evan Wood - or Joseph Fiennes? One might think that industry could do with it better and without being as hair-raising as Elliot Gould in M.A.S.H. <br /> <br /> My voice? A standing turd, all right, but no connection to the sky."

At the same time, the Galactic Empire is secretly building a new space station like the previous Death Star. If this station remains fully constructed, this is the end of the Rebel Alliance. Both Vader and the Emperor are impatient with the delay of the new Death Star, and they have to kill many of their commanders to make the project work. <br /> <br /> R2 and C3po are in Jabba's palace to send a message from Luke to Jabba, where Luke pretends to negotiate Hans's life. He gives R2 and C3po as a gift to Jabba as part of his plan. Jabba does not accept the negotiations because he uses Han Solo as part of the decoration of his palace (Han is still frozen in carbonite). Lando is hid as Jabba's guardian and Chewbacca is also given by a reward hunter to Jabba. When the same Hunter tries to save Han solo and make sure he stays in human form again, we see that Princess Leia is in disguise.

The problem is that Yoda is too old and sick since he's 900 years old, and before he dies, Yoda tells Luke that he does not need more training, but to really be a Jedi, he has to go back to Vader fight. He confirms to Luke that Vader is Luke's dad and that there is another Skywalker besides Luke. In his last moments, Yoda asks Luke to remember his advice about the temptation of the dark side and to pass on his Jedi knowledge to Luke. When Yoda dies, Obi Wan's ghost shows up to Luke and tells him that Luke's father killed his good side Anakin to become Darth Vader, and also that he is more machine than a man since becoming a Sith. Luke remains concerned about killing his own father and says that he feels that his father still has kindness. Obi Wan tells Luke that his twin sister is Leia and tells her why Luke and Leia have been separated since babies. He gives Lukas his last advice and says if he refuses to kill Vader, the Emperor will win the war. <br /> <br /> At the same time, the Emperor tells Vader that he has to give him Luke, if he does, as Luke is stronger than before, and both must combine their efforts to turn Luke to the dark side bring. <br /> <br /> Now we'll have one of the best battles in the Star Wars series As the Rebel Alliance plans to attack the new space station, the ""Death Star 2"", Luke will confront Vader and the Emperor, and Leia, Han and Chewie have to turn off the force field ""Death Star 2"" with the help of EWOKS.

You could say I'm biased on the movie, and OK, I'm, but I did not see the finished product until December 27, 2006, and was very pleased. I'm not a horror movie fan as such, but love the old ""B"" movies and black and white sci-fi movies. This movie will make you ""think"" when something happens, then it does not, then it does. It will totally unbalance you. I would suggest watching the movie first and then the director's notes and peculiarities. It's so well written, directed and filmed and I can tell you personally that working with this cast and crew was a real pleasure. I sincerely hope to be part of Brian and Laurence's future projects."

First, Pachelbel's canon brought a lump to my throat, and the sight of a tiger moth (which my grandfather, my father, and I all had flown) produced a slight moisture around his eyes, and Crowe's name hooked me completely. I was fascinated by this movie, Crowes Performance (again), the subject (and yes, what debt we owe), how different things were addressed and edited, the flight sequences (my father also flew Avro Ansons), the story - and, As another contributor has pointed out, Crowe's recitation of High Flight. I will not spoil the movie for anyone, but, separated from my wife of 4000 miles, as an ex-army officer employed in a few wars and as a private pilot, I admit to crying a few times heartily. Buy it, rent it, download it, beg, borrow or steal it - but watch it. <br /> <br /> PS Have I seen a Bristol Blenheim (in yellow training colors) on the floor? Looked like a twin-engined plane with a twin Browning in a dorsal tower."

Granted, it was on Sci Fi, and I do not watch much Sci Fi, but man, talk about a razor-sharp plot and two-dimensional characters to the max. <br /> <br /> The characters were stereotyped and exaggerated, the plot and setting were incredible, the vampires were less intimidating, more funny-looking, the blood was unnecessary, the special effects were terrible - and the end? Well, the only thing that was unpredictable in the end is when the tomboy suddenly becomes lesbian and does it with the female vampire, which by the way is not really hot, considering that it takes about three seconds for you to get closer to ""what the hell?"" then ""man, that's hot.""

What awaits her at the DLO is far more than that ...","This movie is a wonderfully easy work. To enjoy pleasantly from start to finish is both sad and uplifting at the same time. The performances of Miranda Otto (oh how she deserves so much more recognition!) And George del Hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch as the two tortured souls understand each other. The supportive staffing of Dead Letter Office workers are wonderful little bits in themselves, as well as Alice's boring friend, whom I could not help but felt a little sorry for. There is a certain scene that I can see time and time again (and I have!). It is such a pity that films like these do not get any recognition and therefore bring them further to the public so that more people can enjoy them. I cried, I laughed and I sighed. I would recommend this movie to anyone."

I was really crushed to see the same person Madeleine Engle who wrote the book and made the film, made a great book and a horrible movie. Acting is worse than any direct-to-video action. Yes, I have to admit that there were cool effects. But seriously, they were all terrible and not serial in any way possible. When you read the book, you are overwhelmed by the movie.

Of course, since I was a fan of the TMNT at the time, it obviously caught my interest. When I started watching the show ... to say that I was disappointed with the end result is an understatement. Some time later (more like recently), I had a chance to revisit the series. <br /> <br /> First, let's talk about some of the positive things. They managed to render the Turtles' Cave, as it was last seen in the movies, relatively well, given the limited budget they provided. There is a tendency for this gloomy atmosphere regarding the sets and so on. And the turtle suits, though not the biggest piece of puppetry and whatever, were functional and seemed pretty sturdy for most of the action stuff that would follow in the series. <br /> <br /> People tend to complain about getting rid of Shredder quickly and replacing him with those original villains that could easily be used in a Power Rangers show. But you can only beat Shredder until it gets boring and undermines its value as a villain ... and besides, most fans do not know, or do not remember or just ignore the fact that they're in the original comic Shredder was in the very first issue! Forget the countless resurrections that would follow. From a personal point of view, I was somehow glad that they got rid of Shredder, because then the anticipation grew to the point where they would eventually bring him back in a later episode. I think Shredder works best in small quantities, because then his encounters with the Turtles are all the more memorable. <br /> <br /> Unfortunately, they replace him with those original villains who, as I said, seemed more suited to a Power Rangers show than a Ninja Turtles show. And with these new magically swinging generics comes a new female, magically swinging turtle, the infamous Venus De Milo. I will be honest; I never made friends with her. I am not against the idea of ​​a female turtle; I'm only against the idea of ​​someone who uses magic, and thus stands out as a wild sight in a clan of ninja turtles who seem to be a little out of their domain. I almost have the impression that this could have been the Venus De Milo show dealing with their supposed enemies, and the TMNT are just there to deliver the star power (or whatever, given the time frame left over) remained). Fortunately, they all share the limelight. <br /> <br /> Next Mutation was aired after a season, and the creators were more than happy to ignore it. Given the time and maybe another season, I really believe that this live iteration of the TMNT could have been something and maybe got a shot at size. But while the idea was solid, the execution was flawed (though there are some good episodes in this series). As it stands, Next Mutation is one of those curiosities in Turtledom that is best buried and forgotten."

Receives always negative reviews and harsh criticism. You're almost tempted to think that this is just a contemporary hype. You know, it's popular to hate Uwe Boll, whether you like his movies or not. Let me assure you that this is NOT the case. Uwe Boll is a terrible writer / director and frankly a threat to the entire film industry. ""Seed"" is another unfortunate proof of that. Here, Boll is so desperate to be controversial and shocking that he overlooks many other elements a movie actually needs: plot, narrative structure, character development, build-up of tension? ""Seed"" is an ugly movie full of superfluous dirt and incompetent footage. I once read that ""Seed"" is Uwe Boll's interpretation of Torture's pornography horror trend today, but that's not nearly close. The film undeniably lends some of the influences of ""Saw"" and ""Hostel,"" but basically it's just another x-pure dull slasher with an indestructible killer and video-playing power. <br /> <br /> The first 45 minutes of ""Seed"" are boring and just confirm all the obvious things that you already knew would happen. Boll was stupid enough to start his film with a (lightning fast) scroll text declaring that US law requires that death row candidates be released if three attempts to kill them fail. So you know that's going to happen later, but still the first three quarters are wasted catching a serial killer and putting him on the electric chair. Seed is a dumb serial killer who reportedly killed 666 victims (over the top?) Carrying a bag over his head. He's watching real animal cruelty shootings (and WE are watching real animal cruelties, thanks for that, Mr. Boll) and filming people who are slowly decomposing in their basement (including a screaming baby who is really sick and twisted). When he is finally captured while the most amateurish and implausible police hijab ever filmed and goes to death row, the movie is even more retarded. After he was buried alive because the electric chair could not fry him, Max Seed crawls back to the surface and makes a brand new rampage; This time mainly focuses on the people who arrested him and executed him. <br /> <br /> The pointless plot twists and the complete lack of story depth in this film go way over, just bad; They are downright annoying and insult the intelligence level of an average horror movie fanatic. Multiple twists and subplots in ""Seed"" are simply not acceptable as they are just too stupid! Nobody believes that police and prison staff let a mass murderer live without first shooting bullets through his head. No one will accept that a refugee can not be found for another six months, even though he will return directly to the same hiding place where they first caught him! ""Seed"" is full of smaller things like this and the movie gets dumber with every passing minute. Personally, I refuse to accept that the Cast & Crew member did not notice. It makes you really believe that Uwe Boll simply ignores all advice and criticism and only stubbornly turns his films as he wants. I imagine him telling his actors, ""Shut up and do what's said to you,"" when they realize that the scene they're making does not make sense. <br /> <br /> Just for the fun of pissing off people, there's a gigantic overlong sequence in which Max Seed kills an elderly lady with a hammer while she's shackled to a chair in the middle of her living room. Rather than shock as Boll intended, this episode masterfully embodies how pathetic and controversial the entire movie really is. ""Seed"" is awful, it's disgusting, it's unfortunate, is it ?? Boll."

It's not hateful at all. If the 700 Club offends you, I recommend searching for the remote and turning the channel on your TV.

This cartoon, on the other hand, bears the second warning sign of a boring cartoon: There are too many dialogues. The cartoon has at least more than two jokes up its sleeve, but most of them seem to be taller than they are thanks to the immense padding of the dialogue. At one point, Elmer finishes having dinner and comments, ""That was wowwwy awfuwwyy well off wamb,"" possibly the most superfluous dialogue I've ever heard in a cartoon reading characters text in the later-era Woody Woodpecker cartoons not in my book). Although this cartoon is only 8 minutes long, it feels like 20 thanks to superfluous dialogues. <br /> <br /> Elmer's Pet Rabbit was not a funny cartoon for me, but if you sold your soul to Chuck Jones and you are not able to recognize that he has run a few clunkers during his career, you could enjoy it."
4,tt0228158,0,A story of zombies eating freshly killed humans.,"This thought lost stripe sometimes comes on the internet. So I bought a copy. Well, of course the acting is terrible and the plot is childish, but it has its moments. I think people who searched this one know the back story of it. It was made by a Grindhouse movie theater owner for an extremely low budget. But for me he certainly did not spoil the money for props, but the makeup. The make-up is well done for this type of movie. The zombies are worth seeing and the blood is intact. The only problem with this type of film is the quality of the pelicula. It's awful, luckily no hissing sound, but sometimes it's way too dark. So you have to look closely to see the blood. In a funny way, they were trying to sell this one, not really for Gypsies. A voice-over says at the beginning of the film that one has to watch for a sign and a man who appears with green flashes, indicating that there is blood on the way. Of course that does not work, let me think of Cannibal Girls, had that annoying bell as the red stuff started to flow. They had the original idea, Cannibal Girls was made a year earlier. Do not go for the storyline, go for the zombies and notice a continuity mistake. When the girl and the guy love each other first, she takes her bra, then they love each other and suddenly her underwear is back on ... try to do that or I'll go offline a bit ... eat it ugly corpses"

One night, Carrère finds an ancient journal hidden in a hole in the wall of the cell. They realize that the book was written by Danvers in the beginning of the last century and is about black magic. They decide to read and use its content to escape from the prison, when they find the truth about Danvers' fate.","A prison cell. Four Prisoners - Carrere, a young company director accused of fraud, 35-year-old transsexual in the process of his transformation, Daisy, a 20-year-old mentally retarded idiot Savant, and Lassalle, a 60-year-old intellectual who murdered his wife. Behind a stone slab in the cell, which was mysteriously torn loose, they discovered a book: the diary of a former prisoner, Danvers, who inhabited the cell at the beginning of the century. The Diary contains magical formulas designed to help prisoners ""Malefique"" is one of the scariest and most intelligent horror movies I've seen this year. The film has a grubby, shady feel that is influenced by the works of HP Lovecraft, which creates a very scary and disturbing atmosphere. There is plenty of blood associated with imaginative and brutal death scenes, and the characters of four prisoners are surprisingly well developed. It's a shame that Eric Valette really made a terrible remake of ""One Missed Call"" after his stunning debut.9 out of 10."
9,tt0499537,1,"""Offside"" is about a group of Iranian girls who attempts to enter Tehran's Azadi Stadium dressed as boys in order to watch a big football match but some get caught and arrested. After the establishment of the Islamic Republic in Iran, women are not allowed to enter the stadiums.","At first glance, a movie about women who want to watch a football match would not appeal to someone who has little interest in football like me, but it's not about football, it's about discrimination and the enthusiasm of women for the sport they do love. <br /> <br /> The film begins on the day of a crucial World Cup qualifier between Iran and Bahrain. A girl tries to enter Tehran's Azadi Stadium like a boy. It looks like she'll get it until a soldier tries to search her. Once captured, she is taken to a small enclosure high up on the outside of the stadium, where there are a handful of women who have already been captured. Here they are guarded by a small group of conscripts whose leaders would rather go back home cattle. We never get to know the names of the characters, but we get to know them as humans when the girls ask the guards to watch them through a nearby gap in the wall and if they are turned away try to at least comment. <br /> <br /> Aside from an important point regarding the rigid gender segregation in today's Iran, the film contains many funny moments, like the ""disguise"" that one of the girls has to wear when it comes to the toilet and the girl She disguised herself as a soldier and was caught only because she watched the game from a seat reserved for a senior officer. The enthusiasm of the girls for the game is so great that in the end the spectator will probably be at the height of his place, in the hope that Iran will win and thus reach the finals in Germany. The soldiers are not shown as fundamentalists, they are just recruits who are there because they have to be, and when they explain to the girls why women can not watch male sports, they do not seem to be convinced of their own arguments. <br /> <br /> It's a shame that this movie is not seen in Iran itself, but it's good that the world can see it and see that ordinary Iranians are not fanatics desperate to to fight the West but ordinary people with the same passions and worries as people everywhere. The cast has done a great job by letting their characters appear as real people rather than mere cartoons."
7,tt0031045,1,"A young man just released from a reformatory moves to a new neighborhood with his sister, intending to start a new life. However, he gets mixed up with the local mob boss and corrupt politicians and soon finds himself being framed for an arson and murder he didn't commit.","The film begins with a group of children in the Reform School and focuses on a child named Gabe, who seems to have worked hard to earn his probation. Gabe and his sister move to a new neighborhood to make a fresh start and soon Gabe meets the Dead End Kids. The kids in this movie are little punks, but they are much less antisocial than in other previous movies and deep down, they are well-meaning punks. However, in this area there are also some criminals who commit arson fraud and consider Gabe a comfortable scapegoat - after all, he had been reformed the school and nobody would believe that he was innocent once he was framed. So, when Gabe is ready to be sent back to The Big House, it's up to the rest of the gang to rescue him and expose the real crooks. <br /> <br /> The ""Dead End Kids"" appeared in several Warner Brothers movies in the late 1930s and the films were generally very good (especially ANGEL with dirty faces). However, after the boys' contracts expired, they went over to Monogram Studios, and the movies, to put it mildly, were very weak and formulaic - Huntz Hall and Leo Gorcey were pretty much the whole show and the group was renamed ""Monogram Studios"". The Bowery Boys "". Because ANGELS WASH THEIRE FACES had the excellent writing and production values, AND Hall and Gorcey did not constantly touch the camera, that's a pretty good movie - and earns almost a score of 7 (it's really close). In fact, while this is not a great movie aesthetically, it's certainly a lot of fun to watch, so I'll give it a 7! Sure, it was a bit hokey - especially towards the end when the kids take the law into their own hands and Reagan ignores the Bill of Rights - but it was also very entertaining. The Dead End Kids are doing their best and Ronald Reagan and Ann Sheridan have provided excellent support. Sure, this part of the movie was illogical and impossible, but somehow it was still funny and quite charming - so if you lift the unbelief, it works fine."
4,tt0125430,0,"Sexy air stewardesses - four naughty female flight attendants - become involved with a wealthy womanizer, with unsurprising results. They live out their wildest sexual softcore nude fantasies.","That's the dilemma (above) that Debbie endures at the end of this Sam Sherman production of Naughty Stewardesses. Debbie has just come to town, become a stewardess, slept with an older rich man (who describes her is in her fifties, but has cracked that mark a decade or two ago), shoots nude scenes for a photographer she just finished got to know has central element to a kidnapping / extortion plot. Through all this and in the midst of all these emotional upheavals and spiritual searches, what in the name of Heaven will Debbie do? Well, I can not completely tell, but I do not expect a real epiphany. Let's be honest. Naughty stewardess is exactly what she wants to be (at least two-thirds): a soft-core porn movie with lots of topless women and a funny one in this cheesy 70s movie. There is no great art here. The film was designed to earn money and use a growing trend to put nymphomaniac stewardesses into movies so that audiences could express their voyeuristic tastes. By today's standards, the movie is pretty tame. What makes this movie wrong is in the end a kind of statement movie. Come on, anyone here believes in this little tribute from Debbie as he thinks about life on the beach. She would spend more time figuring out which halter top she will wear that day. And what about the ridiculous act of stealing 50 Grand? It made no sense to me, how on earth did these characters ""dug"" it? Who buys Cal as a member of the PLO (something like that) or even as a director for hardcore pornography? He would be lucky enough to work for Seven Eleven! This, as another reviewer noted, is more of a piece by Sam Sherman and then a play by Al Adamson. You can see if Al is completely responsible. There is practically no budget and the film does not look nearly as polished. Adamson is doing a decent job this time and I have to give Sherman a loan. While this movie is bad for what it should be, it has a certain style. I liked the opening credits with the animation and the photos. I even liked the music of Sparrow. ""Silver Heels"" was a catchy tune. The movie does not look cheap at all. Compare that to EACH of Als Horror movies. As far as the cast is concerned, yes, Bob Livingston is a bit old for the lead role, but some research has been done, and the obvious thread of attracting money from young women to men has also been explored. I had big problems with Robert Smedley, who was just terrible in his role. The girls all have great sets, so what else was required of them, right? Naughty Stewardesses is a relatively harmless 1970s exploitation movie and will serve as a lifetime cap for certain aspects of life in this decade. Incidentally, did I mention that it is a pretty bad picture?"

This first movie was one of the best. The humorous story features a delightful 14-year-old Deanna, a small beauty with a beautiful voice, as the ""Miss Fixit"" in a divorced family. For a summary of the plot, see other IMDb entries, but Deanna and her two older sisters plan to go to America from Switzerland to prevent her father from marrying again. With an excellent supporting actress, especially Barbara Read and Nan Gray as sisters, good direction and editing, the film also succeeds in later sightseeing. Of Deanna's three songs, only ""Il Bacio"" comes from the classical repertoire, but when she sings it in this police station, the place of the film is secured in the story. At least it was for this spectator, who at the age of 15 both with Deanna and with classical music came to life. One of the many nice touches that occur during THREE SMART GIRLS is a quick look at how the drunk stretches his neck to catch a last glimpse of Deanna as the cops drive him! An unfortunate result of this film's success was that later writers for Durbin vehicles were locked up in the ""Miss Fixit"" theme, which quickly became obsolete. Deanna herself never did. Her stature as an actress is more questionable than her charisma, which she certainly had. It seems to me that she, like many other film personalities, has replaced ""naturalness"" for the histrionic ability she lacked. The trick worked well for 21 feature films."

Here in Aag was the number 100 crores for Babban (Amitabh Bachchan, but the poor man was beaten by our so-called hero and had few men's bikes to commute with all automatic weapons.)

Although some say the Enforcer is the best in the series, I do not agree at all. In my opinion, apart from the original Dirty Harry, Sudden Impact and Magnum Force are the only ones worthy of the series. Although The Enforcer is a good movie with some good action sequences, it does not get the dirty and filthy impression the other three films have. This movie captures all the excitement that makes Clint Eastwood movie good, and he has the quotes that make a Dirty Harry movie good. In Diry Harry it is "".. well, yes, punk?""; in Magnum Force ""A man must know his limits""; and in this it's ""Go on, make my day."" Also in this movie, it's nice to see a change of scenery as you're a little tired to see the old San Francisco streets in the other movies in the series.

He casts off much of the psychological hocus-pocus that Lawrence worshiped, and instead focuses on all the naughty parts, so we get a lot of histrionic lovemaking in beds and fields, two naked men in the firelight, and an embarrassing scene with Alan Bates (yup , buck naked again) stray on a meadow and love bush and grass (I'm not kidding). Glenda Jackson won an Oscar for her performance as Gudrun, the more dominant of the two sisters in the storyline, and she's certainly trying her best to do something with this material; Everyone would deserve an Oscar just because he had to endure Russell's decision to give her a scene where she had to dance wildly in front of a herd of mystified cattle.

As far as acting is concerned, all players are very bad. And then, you know, I hated the atmosphere of the ""Society of the Dead Poets"". In fact, that's another movie I hate."

It's soon clear to him that Diana has talent; he pushes her. She spends time with another young fighter, Adrian, who has a girlfriend, but Diana intrigues him and stirs real feelings he tries to articulate. She, too, must accommodate her toughness and ironic detachment to her feelings for him.","Michelle Rodrigez was made for this movie when I saw her for the first time in Fast and the Furious. They could say that she was a strong woman. With this film, she has not only proven her acting, but she is not afraid and hard as she should be in this film. She is more of a bad girl and that's what I like about her. This movie is about a restless girl who lives as Tom Boy and constantly gets into trouble with the school and family. As she is interested in training her brothers to boxer, she decides to fight for her love and asks her trainer to train her. Although they do not believe that they have the potential, they are proven wrong. <br /> <br /> I think the movie ended up being a bit slow but well done. It shows that people can do anything, even if they do not have the potential. I recommend it to be seen."

First of all, the casting could have been better; Katelyn, the main character, did not look like her TV mother. <br /> <br /> Also, the plot was pathedic. it was extremely clichéd and predictable. The end was very disappointing and cheesy. (But that's all I'm going to say). <br /> <br /> The nail in the bag, however, was a scene when Katelyn (Jordan Hinson) should cry, but the girl could not cry on command! no tears streamed down her face, just a few incredible sobs. She is not a dynamic actress at all. she gave the same false little laugh that was identical to that of hillary duff on lizzie maguire (sp?). That was when the movie went from not so good to just bad. it really looked like she was acting. <br /> <br /> In a nutshell: This movie was really bad! it was a mix of every cliché movie from the 1990s that everyone was tired of - only worse! <br /> <br /> I give him an ""F"" because it was so damn hard to sit through (b / t / w, I was babysitter when I saw it). <br /> <br /> However, you may like it if you are 9 or less. ;)"

Any sequel that follows a Romero movie that is not directed by Romero himself has some big shoes to fill, mainly because of the Romero fans out there who think he is God. I did not really care about the first movie and it was funny enough, I did not really care about the sequel. The film series had so much potential, but it was short-lived because both films were less than stellar. <br /> <br /> The biggest problem with CREEPSHOW 2 was that it had only three stories (with the exception of the intermediate story), and because the first story looked implausible, there was only a chance for almost half of the movie really well his. I saw CS 2 in the cinema and the first segment was a real groomer. Everything Dramatic with George ""I Can not Act"" Kennedy is automatically doomed to fail and the story of the Indian statue was too delicate and did not belong in this sequel. After a really dreary and dull start, there were only two more stories left to reverse the fiasco of the aborted start, and unfortunately the other two stories were not big enough to forget the first story. THE RAFT and THE HITCHHIKER are moderately successful, moderate, because although the other two segments have their moments, they still fall flat. The last two stories are basically too long stretched out. It's not that I wanted the stories to happen at a dizzying pace and end quickly, but both good ideas that were found in these stories were made by the fact that they were slow and padded and eventually flat when the Segments were more energetic, nullified. brittle and with punchier ends. Even if the last two stories had not been expanded to fill the film, or if all three segments had been shorter with better editing and direction, they could have added a much needed fourth story to the Bund. With only three padded segments for a boring feast. <br /> <br /> The acting and writing in the segments THE RAFT and THE HITCHHIKER are from horrible to good. I like Lois Chiles in the last segment. It's probably her best moment on screen, apart from her role as Bond Girl Holly Goodhead in MOONRAKER and DEATH ON THE NILE. But even their role is sometimes difficult to understand because of the useful direction and the unfocused story. Should we hate her or sympathize with her? Shall we sympathize with the annoying hitchhiker? If the body of the pickup was found by other people on the street, what was it when he attacked Chile? Was he a ghost or a zombie or something? How did the body abandon the presence of the other people who found it dead to attack Chile? The whole thing is not very clear, even for a supernatural story. And the end is pretty boring and uneventful. <br /> <br /> As for the infamous THE RAFT story, well, acting is mostly on the dreadful side and none of the characters is likable or interesting. The characters would have been more interesting if the actors had played themselves. None of the actors is convincing in its specific roles. Paul Satterfield looks smarter than the stupid jock he plays, and the actress who plays his girlfriend is not as convincing as the typical bitchy bitch. She seems too shy. The same could be said with the other two who play the ""normal"" teenagers. The idea of ​​the killer oil spill is interesting and scary, but not well executed. There should have been a fifth figure, maybe a homeless person or a ranger who lurks around the lake and knows about the oil spill and might have been the alter ego of the watery monster. As scary as the oil spill is, it is not a compelling ""character"". And as the story ends, everything seems pointless. No punch. <br /> <br /> Apart from the few exciting aspects that make it always boring to see CREEPSHOW 2 in a theater, was basically a waste of money and time. CS 2 is more rental material than anything you pay for on the big screen."

I do not understand how it is fun to have sex with a dog (which is also animal abuse). Linda Lovelace was a virtual prisoner who was forced to make these films. I know that some people will criticize this comment, but I'm convinced that this kind of movie is fueling the fire of hatred and more misogynistic feelings.

Reclusive, the pair live with cats and raccoons in Grey Gardens, a crumbling mansion in East Hampton. Edith is dry and quick-witted - a singer, married but later separated, a member of high society. Edie is voluble, dresses - as she puts it - for combat in tight ensembles that include scarves wrapped around her head. There are hints that Edie came home 24 years before to be cared for rather than to care for her mother. The women address the camera, talking over each other, moving from the present to events years before. They're odd, with flinty affection for each other.","When it first came out, this work of the Meysel brothers was much criticized and even considered exploitation. Fortunately, it is now hailed as a documentary cinema masterpiece, especially now that society has been exposed to real exploitation in reality television and the bad development of most direct cinema. <br /> <br /> Really, at first, we have to say that this is not directly cinema, it's more cinematic. The difference between the two is very small, but it is mainly the fact that in this documentary we feel the presence of the brothers Meysels, and they interact with the filmed characters. This also makes it clear that this is not exploitation. The Meyssels have been allowed in the house, and they are contained in a very eccentric situation of a very eccentric household. And Edith and Edie just love the idea of ​​being filmed. <br /> <br /> It would have been very disappointing if only one voice of God's narrative and superficial interviews had been shown. Here we get a full picture of the madness of the house, a madness that is well received both with Edie and with her mother Edith. Their house is a mess, trash and animals everywhere, faded paint and furniture throughout the house, and the constant struggles that are the constant interactions of reality. These two people have lived together all their lives and are not fighting the camera because they want to get the attention, but because they can not help but talk to each other. They know themselves too well to hide their inner feelings, there is no need. But in the end, they really love each other because they blame each other for their lives. Edie says she does not want her mother to die because she loves her very much and Edith says she does not want Edie to leave because she does not want to be alone. <br /> <br /> But the most interesting aspect of the movie is that regardless of her age, the two women can not help being girls. You can not help being one of the singers, the other the dancer. Show all their artistic skills in front of the camera. When Edie asks David Meyssel's rhetorically, ""Where have you been all my life?"" She is really happy that she is finally able to show the whole world and her wonderful showgirl skills. A beautiful portrait of stylistic significance and a charm that will most likely never be seen again, as only the Meysel and few others can do."

And just so you know I'm not going to brag about it, let me say this: of all the animes I've seen, Castle in the Sky is by far one of the best. It's obvious that people say Spirited Away is the best, but I do not agree at all. Most people only know this movie because it's an Acemy Award; This is not an exaggeration - I have shown Princess Mononoke and Castle in the Sky to people who have only seen ""Spirited Away"" and they agree that the latter two are the supervisors of the Three. Personally, I never thought anything would be comparable to Princess Mononoke until I finally saw Castle in the Sky. I still think the Prior is the better of the two, but Castle in the Sky is on par with him; In many ways, Castle has important elements that Mononoke missed. Either way, if you've just seen Spirited Away and think that this is Miyazaki's best movie, be prepared to shake your Earth."

Fist of Legend would have been a much better choice. Anyway, Black Mask is not terrible, but it's not great either. The final combat sequence is well staged by Yuen Woo Ping, who coordinated the matrix. But the English publication suffers from rough editing and synchronization. (I implore the Hollywood studios to release these films uncut with subtitles.) Jet Li shows his characteristic charisma in the title role, and Francoise Yip has a cool, but short, role as a 701. <br /> <br /> Black mask has a strange goth style that arouses some interest, but is overloaded with gun battles and explosions. A bigger focus on Li's fantastic physical abilities was in order. Black Mask is a decent movie, but do yourself a favor and take Fist of Legend with you if you want to watch a great movie showing Li's abilities."

For a parody, you need something called ""humor."" This cheap crap party had no sense of humor, and it made little sense. You basically have a stupid-looking monster (man in a rubber suit) coming out of closets and killing people, I think, since you'll never see the monster violate anyone or any bloody consequences.

What does God have to do with sci-fi? God is only the answer if you can not come up with a rational explanation for something. In fact, this is exactly the issue with the series finale - they obviously could not come up with any reasonable explanation for the multitude of big questions that came up during the series, like Kara Thrace returning from the dead in a brand new Viper, like her old viper and her charred body landed on Earth 2, why Baltar has an imaginary 6 in his head, why 6 has an imaginary Baltar in their head, etc., they explain it with ""angels"" or simply do not explain it at all. <br /> <br /> The plot of the last 2 episodes had holes big enough to let a basestar through. For example, why are Galactica and her crew going on a suicide mission to rescue a girl (Hera), especially after Adama said that he would not attempt a rescue? Because they found out the position of the Cylon base? That's not a good reason to sacrifice the life of the crew. And how did Anders know the place?

They used to be close friends but their differing lifestyles and ambitions, especially that of Anton Newcombe, have forced them apart, to the point of being enemies.","Excellent documentary, allegedly about the friendship and subsequent rivalry between two retro rock'n'roll bands from the West Coast: The Dandy Warhols and Brian Jonestown Massacre. It turns out that this is a portrait of a frontier psychologist - Anton Newcomb - and his tormented relationship with the rest of the world. Interestingly, there is hardly any music for a music documentary. What is there - bits and pieces of songs, mostly broken off by the actors - is rather incidental than central. Although the protagonists are musicians, the story is not about music, but about a particularly American version of a British myth of a cartoon lifestyle, where nobody has to take responsibility to behave like idiots. Tantrums, drugs, violence, gross dysfunctional attitudes, egomania on a truly epic scale - all this is excused or positively encouraged because it's a collective idea of ​​what rock'n'roll is all about. As a film, this is a first-rate documentary, but it raises more questions than it answers. Why, for example, is Anton Musik so conservative? For someone who is so wild and outrageous (and he is wild and outrageous), his music never seems to have gone beyond the most obvious derivations of his idols of the '60s (The Stones, Velvets, etc.) For someone who claims to play 80 instruments It has never bothered to play any of them beyond the rudimentary level. Likewise, Dandy Warhol's burning ambition is based on a vision of rock'n'roll, which astoundingly petrified in 1969. Of course, nothing is wrong with Pastiches, but of course there is more to life than living a cartoon of the late 60s. Why do not they take risks with their music - just as their role models did? Because one suspects that it is not about music. Music is just an accessory, a support or an excuse to lead completely dysfunctional and irresponsible lives. But why? In the case of Dandy Warhol, the answer is obvious: make a lot of money and be famous. Big thing. Anton Newcombs case is more interesting. He's obviously very talented, but every time he gets the opportunity to reach a wider audience, he sabotages it, usually in the most dramatic way. He is terribly afraid of success, and at the same time he annoys anyone who has it - especially his former friends, the Dandy Warhols. Fascinating movie. Highly recommended."

Usually, I am enthusiastic about modern retellings if they are treated well. It is usually interesting to see the parallels between past and present in a known story. Unfortunately, this film was less of a modern retelling and more of a pop culture perversion. The adaptation of the characters of the original appeared youthful and usually proved to be terribly annoying. It probably did not help that the actors were not very good either. Most appearances were ridiculously exaggerated, which was probably due to a bad direction or a bad script. I did not even laugh at the time of the movie. All jokes were outdated clues to not so current events that will lose their sharpness over time. Really, the only highlight of the movie was the opening sequence in which the White Rabbit is about to meet Alice, but even then the score was a poor imitation of Danny Elfman's work. Also, I have to say that converting the croquet game into a rave dance-off was terrible. It was undoubtedly the low point of the film. <br /> <br /> What a joke. Do not see this movie.

David Breckinridge (Kiefer Sutherland) is a fellow Secret Service agent who learned most of what he knows from Garrison and holds him in great respect. When intelligence data suggests that there is a mole within the Secret Service who is part of a plot to assassinate President Ballentine (David Rasche), Garrison launches an investigation to ferret out the rogue agent, and asks Breckinridge to go over the evidence with a fine-toothed comb.

Garrison eludes his captors and struggles to prove his innocence while tracking down...","It is good. It's bad. And then it's The Sentinel, a political thriller that's one of the worst films I've ever seen. The act of a mole in the Secret Service is a good one, but never was a movie so thoroughly slaughtered with so much potential. Directed by Clark Johnson, every actor in this film is programmed on autopilot. Even the great Michael Douglas looks bored here. I can honestly say that I've NEVER seen another movie with so many glaring holes in my life. The phrase is predictable from the beginning, and the character's motives are so ridiculously ridiculous that they made the audience laugh. Avoid this at all costs.

I hated this movie so much that I still listened to the parts I did not like, which was basically the whole movie.

It is extremely uneven and contains many disturbing elements. Take, for example, the change between black and white and color. If done right, this could be quite effective, but because it was done badly, it became a nuisance and only detrimental to the already bad experience; Much of the film had a strange feeling. The drama was not bad for a mixed movie, but on the other hand it was downright embarrassing at other times. Many of the events were incoherent and confusing in the end. How did it happen that this family was in many of the big events in the 60s? The end was far too cheesy for my taste; because it was hollywoodized, everything had to go out in the end. I would advise you not to waste your time in the sixties and do something different with your time. I'm glad I saw it in class, not at my own time.

After several mishaps and much confusion, things begin to come together for them.","The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and enjoyable, with the gang filling its modest college musical with the bright (but volatile) lights of Broadway with typically naive optimism. Of course, their first attempt fails and Kermit (leader of the group and author of the show) blows his top; So the others all go their separate ways so that he does not feel responsible for them. Kermit herself makes friends with a young wannabe fashion designer who makes ends meet by serving food in her dad's restaurant (the old man then has a snake in particularly tortuous non-reservations!). We get the usual cameo appearances from a variety of stars: Art Carney (as producer), James Coco (as overzealous dog owner), Dabney Coleman (as con artist), Elliott Gould (who also starred in THE MUPPET MOVIE [1979]), Gregory Hines, Liza Minnelli (as she herself replaces her portrait in a classic restaurant with Kermit, with a fake mustache, as a supposedly celebrated entrepreneur in a ruse to promote the Muppets show), Brooke Shields, and even director John Landis (Perhaps the funniest scene in the movie as a Broadway producer, before which Kermit behaves like an actor who behaves like a street musician and merrily rides around sunglasses and an afro wig!). The other Muppets go through more or less their typical steps, but this time Gonzo has (unfortunately) less space; while Miss Piggy is something of an acquired taste with me, the scenes in which the latter spies on what she takes to be Kermit's romance with the waitress? and above all, her violent reaction to it? are undeniably funny. What is disappointing, however, is the Klimahow itself (after a rather superfluous middle section, in which Kermit gets amnesia and eventually commercials on Madison Avenue) that, unlike the anticipated, tangy routines, is nothing more original than the wedding ceremony of Kermit and his eternal flame Miss Piggy!"

Considering that two music videos were opened first, I did not know what to expect as they were very fast and attention grabbing. I was not sure if I was ready for a short film right away. But to my surprise that was really fun. I thought the lead actor, the demon, was really good. I was so impressed with his performance that I checked his name. I was surprised to see that this was the Witchblade type. He has become really good, especially since then! Either that or he got lousy roles or was urged by the director really hard for this brief moment. The girl did a good job. I think it's been hard since it was her first performance and so young. The father has also done well. There was a lot of really nice CG work for a short one, both for this one and for the short next ""Mexican Hat"" which was nice too, but I enjoyed it the most because it had the most depth and emotion and me really about the characters. The other was a very simple story. The story was pretty illustrative and dark! It dealt with real issues with a more fanciful approach to keep people like me interested. We will not even talk about the last movie in the block I left. My only complaint is that I just wish I had seen more of the demonic character and started a little less, so I gave him a 9 out of 10 score. I also thought that the credits were a bit slow. Otherwise, it was beautifully told, directed and edited. The timing was very nice with a complete change from the fast MTV editing that's going on today. This director will get more in the future than the actor. I'll call him the Sorrows Lost actor now, not the Witchblade guy."

Personally, I've found that watching this movie for three hours seems like a breeze, it's really just that big. <br /> <br /> this movie is one of those movies that is so good and so good that not only you are done forgetting that this movie was made in the crappy 80s, but that it actually makes you a bad guy ..

However, there is no exception without exception, such as ""El Mariscal del Infierno"" aka. ""The Devil's Possessed"" (1974) proves. While the film has the specific Naschy-Flick charm, unfortunately it draws way too much and gets really, really boring in between. Naschy plays the evil baron Gilles De Lancré, who oppresses people and uses black magic and bloody rituals to stay in power. As Gaston de Malebranche (Guillermo Bredeston), who fought side by side with Gilles De Lancré against the British, learns of the bad behavior of the Baron, he decides to turn against his former comrades in arms and to liberate the people from the satanic baron rule. Directed by León Klimovsky, who is best known for directing Naschy's ""La Noche De Walpurgis"" (1971), the screenplay is by Naschy himself. Naschy often wrote his own films, and one I have to say that most of the time he did a better, more original job than is the case here. ""El Mariscal del Infierno"" is more of a historical adventure than a horror movie, and in the middle it gets pretty boring. It often resembles the Sword and Sandal films of the 50s, except that this film plays in the Middle Ages. The satanic part was probably added only because the name of the great Paul Naschy is associated with the horror genre. The film has its good sides: Paul Naschy makes strange speeches, Paul Naschy looks weird, Paul Naschy makes satanic stuff, Paul Naschy tortures innocent victims, etc. But unfortunately most of the film focuses on the boring hero and the good guys, and These moments are boring. The female actors are nice to look at, but unlike most Naschy films, they have no nudity and no veil. While there is some blood, it usually looks clumsy and is not as fun as most other Naschy films do. Overall, ""El Mariscal Del Infierno"" is worth a look only for my Naschy enthusiasts. There are dozens of films with the Spanish horror deity to be seen before this, such as ""El Jorobado De La Morgue"" (1973), ""La Orgia De Los Muertos"" (""The Hanging Woman"", 1973) , ""El Espanto Surge De La Tumba"" (1973), ""Latidos De Panico"" (""Panic Beats"", 1983), ""Rojo Sangre"" (2004) or another of the ""Waldemar Daninsky"" Werewolf films.

Besides, unlike other brave heroes who usually have an impressive list of talents, this man has no, unless of course, you sleep a talent to sleep.

Put the characters from the first two films together and you have the seeds of his great ""Grand Illusion"" and ""Rules of the Game"". This is beautifully filmed, with the restless camera taking full advantage of the amazingly large apartments and backstage areas that dominate the interior of the movie, and the often-outdated drama also offers some great moments, especially from Werner Krauss's Muffat. But the glamorous and sultry Ms. Hessling, who seems to be giving Louise Brooks a run for her money in vampire-seeking, never goes beyond a monotonous, selfish whoredom. Maybe this is partly a problem with the script, which mostly causes highlights and indignant emotions; If I did not read the novel, I'm not really sure if the decisions were good or not. <br /> <br /> Nevertheless, the differences between the candidates of Nanas have been good, and I especially liked the relationship between Muffat and Jean Angelos Vandeuvres - the tragic understanding that everyone seems to have of his last fate and sympathy, especially in the scene at the foot of the huge staircase where Vandeuvres warns Muffat and we wonder if violence will break out - these and other glimpses of the lazy rich ridiculous help to give the movie the depth it has. <br /> <br /> Far from his greatest achievement, and for me probably just the shy overall of ""Whirlpool of Destiny,"" this is still worth seeing for Renoir fans or anyone else interested in silent film."

The rather simple story of an adulterous beetle pair seeking both stimulation outside of their marriage is similar to a biographer or vitagraph short in time. Starewicz's story revolves around the use of embalmed beetles with wires that stretch legs in a single-frame animation. The story begins when Mr. Beetle is unknowingly caught in front of the camera by a jealous locust with a dragonfly from the local nightclub. When Mr. Beetle comes home to find his wife in the arms of her artistic friend, he chases her around angrily, but finally forgives her and takes her to watch a movie. However, Mrs. Beetle soon finds out about her husband's unfaithfulness as the movie they see is the jealous grasshopper of Mr. Beetle and the dragonfly. Mrs. Beetle hits Mr. Beetle with her umbrella, Mr. Beetle jumps through the screen, and they both end up in jail after the projector they've captured goes up in flames. The insects are placed in humanized environments such as a house or a nightclub and receive human characteristics such as jealousy, anger, lust and revenge. The insect figures carry briefcases, drive cars and even wear shoes, but they also twitch their antennae and open and close their jaws like real insects. The novelty of the story is not exhausted, even after several considerations, but as fluid as the movements are, the film moves slowly. Action happens with complicated details, but speed and a faster speed of filming is lost. Despite its speed, the film is a prime example of Starewicz's early puppetry and is highly recommended."

I'm not saying the drama was good because it was not, but every actor / actress was hot and attractive. <br /> <br /> One of the lows is that the movie will only get exciting after the first 40 minutes or so. The rest was pretty boring. Another downside (or you could use it as an up if you want to) is the excessive nudity. All 4 girls were topless for a few minutes and all the guys showed their butts for a long time. It's not that I'm against nudity, but that was a horror movie, not 'The Dreamers'. <br /> <br /> Unless you are very desperate to see a guy take off his swimsuit and walk around naked for a few minutes, or watch a girl go nude for no reason, or you're a die-hard fan of Debbie Rochon, as this is the movie for you. But if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away."

Afraid of confronting her ex-fiancé, who dumped her two years before, she hires a top-drawer male escort (Mulroney) to pose as her new boyfriend.","Too much of something borrowed Class B - <br /> <br /> Super Bowl Sunday is one of the slowest days in cinemas every year. For this reason, movie studios tend to avoid larger budget movies on the weekend. Every few years, a studio publishes an opposite women's movie (2001: ""The Wedding Planner"") to compete with the big game. Entitled ""The Wedding Date,"" this Super Bowl weekend will seek to succeed and attract viewers who are not watching the game. <br /> <br /> Sick of people who feel sorry for her, single-woman, Kat-Ellis (Debra Messing, TV ""Will and Grace"") hires male escort Nick (Dermot Mulrony, ""About Schmidt""), to ask her as her friend for her sister's wedding in London. Her family has made it difficult for her not to be married, and her ex-boyfriend of seven, who has left her for no reason, is the best man. To make him jealous Kat cat catapults her ex so he sees what he misses. But in the end, Nick Kat helps to realize that she can open up and someone loves her. <br /> <br /> The movie borrows too much from similar wedding movies. It is almost a 1999 punch ""Picture Perfect"" and mixes in scenes similar to ""The Wedding Planner"" and ""My Best Friends Wedding"". The film also has a reverse ""Pretty Women"" theme, and since it knows its audience, the director makes clever references to this and other films. <br /> <br /> ""The Wedding Date"" has all the clichéd elements of a typical wedding movie is the stereotypical dominant mother (Holland Taylor, ""Legally Blonde"") and practically plagiarized wedding speeches of the family and friends at the wedding and rehearsal dinner. The turn at the end was made before, but it was something that was not fully expected. The real reason why Kat was dumped is surprising and changes the direction of the movie for the last half hour. <br /> <br /> Although ""The Wedding Date"" is predictable, it can be alone. Debra Messing, in her first lead, proves that she can be charming and funny. Dermot Mulrony has a great chemistry with Debra Messing, but most of his dialogues were too bleak and unrealistic. He is able to make the most of what he has been given and to be able to save the character. <br /> <br /> The use of many clever puns (often sexual) makes the movie funny. Although it's mostly a chick-flick, the movie has components that everyone can enjoy. The good mood story and humor make it the best date movie released in a long time."

A plot of jealousy and rage transpires in this classic Shakespearean tale.","I've always enjoyed Kenneth Branagh's versions of the Shakespearean classics, as he's always doing a very good job, but in this movie, the one who stars in the movie is nothing but ""the always-great-actor"" Laurence Fishburne. Surely he's made some bad decisions in movies, even though he's a wonderful actor, but in this we really have the real Othello: the passion, the intensity of jealousy, as she gets stronger along with Fishburn's well-portrayed paranoia and besides, we finally have a black Othello! <br /> <br /> I do not think they could have chosen a better Othello. Who else could have given him that mixture of sympathy / antipathy, love / hate and, not to forget, those fiery eyes ...? Branagh is good as always, but not at his peak, Iréne Jacobs Desdemona is pretty good, but a bit bleak, while Laurence Fishburne really lifts her and makes it a very interesting and entertaining movie.

This film is based on Truman Capote's hauntingly detailed, psychologically penetrating nonfiction novel. While in prison, Dick Hickock, 28, hears a cell-mate's story about $10,000 in cash kept in a home safe by a prosperous rancher. When he's paroled, Dick persuades ex-con Perry Smith, 31, to join him in going after the stash. On a November night in 1959, Dick and Perry break into the Holcomb, Kansas, house of Herb Clutter. Enraged at finding no safe, they wake the sleeping family and brutally kill them all. The bodies are found by two friends who come by before Sunday church. The murders shock the small Great Plains town, where doors are routinely left unlocked. Detective Alvin Dewey of the Kansas Bureau of Investigation heads the case, but there are no clues, no apparent motive and no suspects...","I'm from Sweden and I have just watched this movie and the thing is that I thought it was alright. I've seen a lot of bad comments about it, but you have to remember that many people who see this two-part miniseries are around the world, not just in the US. Remember too, that not everyone has ever heard of the movie that was made in the 1960's and maybe not in the events (murders). And even more ... that it's hard to find the original movie and if so, then there are always people who do not like black and white movies. This one feels fresh and in color and will find its publicity. It is now 12 years old, but I saw it for the first time. I will try to find the first one if I compare them, but I have not seen them anywhere in Sweden. Ofcorse is internet but not for anyone in the world. The thing here is that this is largely part of an American crime story and in the 50-60: s was just great in just USA, but in the rest of the world it just over by, I think. Well, it has been told for some time, but 40 years later it will disappear in Europe, for example, as time goes by. We had our own problems and crimes. So, if someone makes the remake of the movie and puts it back into the light, that's not a bad idea. A new generation can take part in this terrible story and even the movie about Capote, which was released a few years ago, was also a pretty good movie, I think. It will boost interest in the events that took place about 50 years ago and perhaps prevent it from falling asleep. It started me and now I'm looking for the Robert Blake version, so it was not that bad ... huh? These are my opinions. Of course, some people will not agree, but hey ... it's okay. Sometimes it will be good to do remakes on old films. It's not every time that the old ones are so good. The techniques of filmmaking have evolved a lot and scenes can become more realistic if they want it today. It's always a question of money, of course. There were so many films made in the ""good old days,"" but they also lacked money, bad directors, etc., and they're redoing them today (fifty years later) and suddenly they're alright. My friend got this box of old classic horror movies and s / f and I can not say that I was impressed by the so-called good old days. Most of them are placed in the dustbin in the bin. They were so bad that we just sat there like zombies ... could not move ... like brain dead. I can not recommend it to anyone. Some of them I have seen remakes of and I remember liking them ... but not the originals. They were just painfully horrible. That's like in the old story, who was the best Bond ... Moore or Connery ... I think if you first see Roger Moore, then you might find the one you trust or like ... Thanks for me and I'm sorry my english, that's not so good. / Lars from Sweden"

Just as easy and successful. Not only in his goal, but also in making a wonderful movie, especially visually. He knows how to use pans, slow-motion sequences, camera shots, crane shots, etc. in a nice, smooth way. This gives the movie a very relaxing feeling. <br /> <br /> The story is about the lives of 8 very different characters who have nothing in common except one thing: a party they all visit, which is also the turning point of this movie. The beauty of this image is not the question of how the characters interact (compared to a similar, of course, better movie like Magnolia). I just do not think that was Barman's idea. The beauty lies in the various details of the experiences that people go through making or breaking their lives. Barman is very successful in telling these little stories that describe small experiences. He knows people ... and Antwerp. <br /> <br /> The soundtrack of the film is also excellent, but no surprise, because we know that Barman is also a very successful songwriter and musician with his band dEUS. The music is sometimes hot and relaxing at the same time, which contributes to the film's sunny, soft feel. Other times we hear funky pop / rock tunes that give some scenes the strength they need. <br /> <br /> There is only one mistake and that is the last half hour. Was it the runtime that broke me? Or were the last scenes not as fresh and exactly as the scenes until then? I can not find it out ... <br /> <br /> All in all a beautiful sunny movie that lifts the Belgian cinema. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10! <br /> <(It's the breeze that flows through the hair of a girl on a sunny afternoon, making her even more beautiful, it's the fresh breeze that relaxes you when she passes a crowded party when someone opens the door opens the perfume of the beautiful girl sitting next to you in the park that you met a week ago, it's the breeze .....) <br /> <br />"

A good hour of this film in the middle is filled with dialogues, a lack of action, the lack of developing a tangent plot that is pretty much NOTHING about the premise that we're exposed to. It has more to do with the relationship between her and the boy, as well as with the boy with his conspiracy group, where the producer / director did not have time to do the Elba work, and yet devoted a part of the film to the topic. It would have been much better if they had just cut this whole hour and had developed the story in themselves through another film and had focused on the martial arts aspect. Speaking of which, I really do not believe in the choreographer of Iron Monkey who has the action sequence in Princess Blade. I was utterly offended by the frequent use of slow motion and fast camera shots to illustrate the physical speed of the assassins. I just did not buy it. <br /> <br /> Please ... I warn you please PLEASE do not waste your time / money with this movie.

Director Parks, who was already known for his coverage of controversial issues in his photography, is not afraid of the glaring of the story.

Johnny Weissmuller plays Tarzan, a monosyllabic, untyped variety, unlike Edgar Rice Burroughs' creation; but he is honest, loyal, courageous and very brave, and he must be during this narration. As Jane Parker, his wife, who had been Jane Porter in the novels, Maureen O'Sullivan is very attractive and lively, as well as athletic, where the script demands this quality.

Tarzan rides an elephant, whom he brought back to life in time; In a spectacular elephant scene, he rescues Jane and what's left of the expedition, who returns a little richer, but much wiser, while Jane continues her wild idyll with her new husband. The film was designed by set-design wizard Cedric Gibbons, and also very pretty. His work and lighting are the outstanding achievements of this entertaining and exciting film, which, despite all the shortcomings of Hollywood, is real from start to finish. Neil Hamilton is a very good Harry, Paul Cavanagh is even better before and after he turns out to be absolutely bad. Forrester Harvey and Nathan Curry complete a small cast very professionally. An unusual and well-realized fantasy film with interesting situations and strong dialogue confrontations. Recommended."

Scott - typographical like Scrooge - is shuddering mean and mean, making his transformation all the more wonderful and moving. I think it's up there with his performance in Patton. The spirits are all effective, each more gruesome than the last. Watching the dark, hovering, skeletal shape of the Christmas spirit that comes to me every year makes me shudder every year.

The fact that it has a threadbare history is bad enough that it tacked it around the subject of football violence makes it 100 times worse. <br /> <br /> I had serious doubts about the premise of this movie before I started to watch, but openly enough, even to accept that the authors thought it best to put Elijah Woods character Matt in the Introduce hooligan scene. <br /> <br /> But the film throws inaccuracy at inaccuracy at the point that gets you more contracted in the middle of the film each time than before. <br /> <br /> Let's clarify a few things: hooligans do not tend to smash their own pub before a run -for-the-league game; they do not set out to kill each other; They not only carry Stone Island (and others in the crowd, hooligans or not, do). They certainly did not do it when they were replaced by a new member of the company to trudge cakes and porridge into the territory of their competing companies. And I would love to meet the hool who would go and browse the top boy of his company to the rival company. (Although you can scratch what I said to kill each other, if there is one). <br /> <br /> Do not get me wrong, I have not seen a movie on the subject that does not work. It contains some fantasy whims, but this is on par with The Firm for cluelessness. <br /> <br /> I found it ironic that Woods' American archenemy is morally condemned by his character to be a cocaine consumer if that is part and parcel of the British hooligan scene. The film does not challenge Wood's morale and instead directs with coke from the company. <br /> <br /> I could go on, but I think I made my point. <br /> <br /> As far as the plot is concerned, it's very unimaginative, and I'm sure if I had not spent the entire movie applauding the points and made more about it, then I'd have guessed what was going on as me. And believe me, I was well ahead. <br /> <br /> I have the distinct impression that this film is aimed at men in the hope that women will enjoy injecting emotional issues. <br /> <br /> If I'm right, then the creators have failed completely. It is too unrealistic to be enjoyed by anyone who is familiar with the scene, and I can not believe that the kind of woman looking for emotional films would be damned for her violent inclinations. <br /> <br /> Are there any good points? Maybe the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed, but I'm rarely impressed with slow-mo action, certainly not when it's a fight, since the point is that a jolt is rousing enough anyway. <br /> <br /> There are some funny, albeit unrealistic moments. Wood's way to school brought a smile for me. But a few mild funny moments barely make up for two hours of completely manufactured scabies. <br /> <br /> If you are British, avoid it like the plague, if only so as not to further misunderstand the scene if you are not in the know. If you are American you can enjoy it as it is clearly tailored to the market. But no one can deny that the plot is weak, predictable and ultimately exaggerated."

In fact, no other book has influenced me so much. This is not necessarily a good thing - it has cleared up my own personal struggle and has more seriously accepted the futility of my own struggle. Houellebecq's insights are masterfully captured by Harel, and the hero's apathy and indifference to a world that rejected him is perfectly portrayed. This is a film that reveals today's society for the lesser man in all its horror. Hopefully things will change in the future, but for the time being we have to accept the rat race, as shown in this movie. It's probably best that Harel or Houellebecq not make such a brilliant work again. One is enough for every man."

4,tt0099578,0,A killer is given the gas chamber after committing several demonic murders. His spirit is released and given power by the Devil. Now the cop that caught him before must find a way to do it again.,"People tried to make me believe that the premise of this disgusting supernatural horror / thriller was inspired by the last words of a real serial killer (whose name I miss for the moment). While waiting for his execution in the electric chair, he claimed that his soul would come to life again and continue to experience an endless murder rush. By the way, it's not a very original idea to make a horror movie. Other low budget turkeys have exactly the same basic requirements as ""House 3"", ""Shocker"" and ""Ghost in the Machine"". However, ""The First Power"" (a.k.a ""Pentagram"") is not a terrible effort, but the script returns to stereotypes and lacks a real thrill. The film begins as a neat, albeit banal serial killer movie in which the obsessive cop hero Lou Diamond Philips pursues a madman who cuts bloody pentagrams into the breasts of his victims. He receives unexpected help from a spiritual medium, played by the beautiful and underrated Tracy Griffith. She leads him to the murderer, but he does not ask him to execute him, as this would lead to an even greater catastrophe! Thanks to Tess's useful tips, Detective Logan quickly captures the killer and celebrates his death sentence, but Patrick Channing makes a pact with Satan himself and returns to the rotted streets of California to kill more. ""The First Power"" gets pretty bad when the killer reincarnates as a vengeful ghost. Instead of using his newfound satanic powers to wipe out the whole world (which I would do in his position), Channing simply prefers cat and mouse games with his archenemy copper. Annoyingly, he constantly calls him ""Buddy Boy"" and possesses the bodies of Logan's friends and colleagues to outsmart him. Although it's never really boring or badly implemented, it's a very weak movie that you have to endure, especially because you always have the feeling of deja vu. Writer / director Robert Resnikoff shamelessly uses every dreadful cliché (the murderer was sexually abused as a child) and even the lines of the players are easy to predict. As soon as Griffith declares that she is capable of predicting the future, she knows that somewhere in the movie she'll say the ridiculously overused line: ""I tell people how to live, but my own life is a mess."" , Yawning. The performance of Lou Diamond Philips is sufficient, but it is quite difficult to take the youthful rebels of ""La Bamba"" and ""Stand And Deliver"" seriously, as a hard copper. There are also decent supporting roles for Mykelti Williamson (""Forrest Gump""), Carmen Argenziano (""When a stranger calls"") and B-movie horror legend David Gale (""Re-Animator"") appears in a tiny cameo at the very beginning of the film Movie."

The film is about prejudice, male dominance, the state of art, values ​​and above all warmth. <br /> <br /> I can not recommend this movie enough. The whole movie is in loops. Everything has a meaning. It's a long story that has been edited so well that the movie's length is just 91 minutes. A total satisfaction. It's an artistic movie for five minutes, the next five minutes is a sad movie, the next five minutes is a thriller. It constantly changes his mood, as if his protagonist is changing his face. The last scene on the rope is phenomenal. History and script are immaculate. Actors are brilliant. Both protagonists are artists, where you can see how they occurred. Very impressive. It was not even nominated for an Oscar. This year 'English patient' received the best Oscar and in the category for foreign films won 'Kolya'. ""Kolya"" was just fine and about ""English patient"" said the smaller the better. Watch it 9/10."

Claw's plan is to thwart Gadget once and for all by using a newer ""cooler"" criminal investigator to destroy Gadget's popularity. Unfortunately, the film fails miserably, the series was great, but it was revived with tragic consequences almost 20 years later. Without the voice of Don Adams as Inspector Gadget, it just does not cut anymore; Dr. Not only is Claw visually less scary, he sounds more like a cold-blood wrestler than his original intimidating self. Granted, this is a children's movie, but the plot is so painfully weak (forbid skies, I mention the animation) that it fades in comparison to the original series. Someone has also decided to update Penny to bring her two decades up, she now has a rebellious clothing style quasi-punky and does not play half the role she has played in the TV series. The gadget mobile speaks, as well as a plot-angle focusing on talking cars. Maybe I'm just a kid who loved the show that was flared up, but I thought that the live action version was more painful than I could stand, but now they go off and ignite this complete dilution of the high quality TV series us.

Let's see: First, they get every willing TV preacher to make this film the biggest since slicing white bread. NEXT encourages as many fundamentalist Christians as possible to buy copies of the film in order to regain their meager production costs and supplement their advertising budgets. And, FINALLY, when the movie hits the cinemas, get as many Christians as possible to see it again, if necessary, into the multiplexes, NOT the movie itself, but the opening of the first box office as a kind of profound spiritual Seen victory. <br /> <br /> But of course that will not be enough. I imagine that any film critic with the audacity to give ""left behind"" anything but a glowing review is considered ""anti-Christian."" <br /> <br /> Of course, this shamelessly manipulative marketing campaign should not surprise anyone. After all, it's a good old-fashioned capitalism at work. What surprised me is how many people got sucked into the whole ""left behind"" mentality. As someone who tries to reconcile his spiritual beliefs with a sense of reason and rationality, it makes me scratch my head. It seems that there are many MANY people who actually believe that there will be a ""Rapture"" sometime in the near future and that millions of people all over the world will disappear into THIN AIR at the same time. What kind of reality, I wonder, do these people live? Is this ""Rapture"" something that you actually believe in, or is it something that you want to fervently believe in?

Imagine, you would come to the realization that everything came true, as the evangelists had warned for years and that there was something greater than just the cold, hard, physical reality that we inhabit. Would not that be something? <br /> <br /> But in the end, it's this cold, hard, physical reality that I'll settle for.

Yes! Cheesy special effects sometimes? Yes! Deliciously guilty pleasure most of the time? Yes! More about Carl Kolchak and Darren McGavin? Yes! I've always enjoyed science fiction as a kid, but I found so much crap from Dracula / Frankenstein / Mummy / Horror stuff. It took Abbott and Costello to give me a new perspective on the classic universal monsters, and Carl Kolchak took me to the ""dark side"" of entertainment. The duke had Rooster Cogburn, Eastwood had Dirty Harry, Garner had Maverick and Rockford, Selleck had Magnum and Darren McGavin had Carl Kolchak. Mixed with all those weak scripts, cheesy special effects, that baroque group of minor characters and actors and guest stars, there was Darren McGavin as Carl Kolchak. He had a dry sense of humor despite the danger, was an idealist in his quest for truth, and a realist in accepting compulsory incompetence and eventual cover-up by government officials. In contrast to 98% of us, Kolchak was also willing to keep his head out and do what had to be done, even if it meant his end, the end of his journalistic career or jail time. Carl Kolchak was a man of charm and wit who started a beautiful, classic, yellow Mustang (then an old used car) on his way to save the day for humanity. Just about every other fictional hero Carl Kolchak was the annual hero, brought to life for a week every week thanks to Darren McGavin.

Burke plays an overweight lawyer who kills the daughter of a gypsy and is cursed by her father (Constantine from TV's ""Room 222"") to several pounds a day. <br /> <br /> As I said, it starts well, but why do you involve the gangster (Mantegna)?

Remember, this is Stephen King, we talk. <br /> <br /> And the end ... almost the same as the book, but a little too talky.

It's just as good that it never happened, since Fetchit's characterization of the lazy Negro was amusing in small doses and would be considered very offensive today. Many of the scenes I've just described are good for a few laughs, though the final sequence was so confusing that the results were just too blah for me. In summary, A Tough Winter is a curiosity that should be seen at least once. By the way, Stepin's real name was Lincoln Theodore Perry."

Stephen Dedalus, who fancies himself as a poet, embarks on a day of wandering about the city during which he finds friendship and a father figure in Leopold Bloom, a middle-aged Jew. Meanwhile, Bloom's day, illuminated by a funeral and an evening of drinking and revelry that stirs paternal feelings toward Stephen, ends with a rapprochement with Molly, his earthy wife.","The film adaptation of James Joyce's Ulysses is excellent. The actors, the voices, the direction, everything captures the feeling of the novel, without sacrificing its own merits. The Milo O'Shea does an excellent job as Leopold Bloom, the horned man married to the saucy Molly. I love this picture."
2,tt0291833,0,"A gruesome homage to the cult Amicus anthology Asylum, Cradle of Fear unfolds four screamplays all linked by the unspeakable need of an incarcerated child killer to wreak vengeance on those responsible for his imprisonment. Helped by deranged angel Dani Filth, who leaves a trail of charnel house death in his crimson wake, the cannibal convict forces two Goth vamps to endure a one night stand from hell, two tough female robbers to see through each other, an obscenely rich coke-head to chop up more than a few lines and an internet surfer to descend into madness when he uncovers the ultimate web depravity.","Well, look, I'm not going to lie to you, but I just got this movie from a friend for $ 3.99 because he had Danni Filth, the lead singer of the ever-popular Death Metal band ""Cradle Of Filth."" Of course, I was expecting violence and bloodshed at its best, as Mr. Filth can explain in a storyline. <br /> <br /> But, dear God, I was so wrong. This movie is seriously biting, big time. Since this is a low-budget movie (haha, wait, make ZERO BUDGET), the beautiful Howard Stern orchestral scores and the Spielberg special effects are obviously lacking. No, it's all a camera, bad angles and bad blood scenes. Take, for example, when our star and violent enemy, Mr. Filth, brutally kills a mugger. A jerk at the throat and blood spits out, but oh my god, it looks like there's a jar of blood in the man's shirt. <br /> <br /> Dir Cradle Of Filth Fans: You'll hear two songs throughout the movie, but with the camera angles and shabby movies, they pull all the enjoyment of the song DOWN. <br /> <br /> My last comment: Control far away. It's blood, blood, breasts and hey, even a sloppy story about it. So, if you like vile violence, almost no voices (yes, there are hardly any words in this movie), then definitely buy it. But if bad movies are not your thing, avoid them. Do not waste your money."

So he buys a van to help with this task. The drama is lame, the comedy is pathetic, and the script is nothing more than a loose chain of clichés and cheap thrills. The creators of the film obviously wanted to capture some of the craziness of other films of that time, but were far from it. They even resort to Bobby slipping on a banana peel because that's supposed to add a comedic value. <br /> <br /> I struggle to find a redeeming feature of the movie. If you like DeVito, that's another classic DeVito role - but he's just a supporting actor and there for cliche value."

Do not waste time or money on this movie, acting is bad, the story is just one of the worst I've ever seen and the script was just awful. There was nothing good about it, you think in the end why I watch this crap. The plot had so many holes and they were never enlightened at the end, it was just so bad, I do not know how a movie could be made so terrible. As I said, I love horror movies and I was so disappointed it was an 18, but you see little blood and no frights or jumps. What annoyed me was how stupid things happened in the movie that did not make any sense how the siblings kissed, why? Everything I can say. Do not worry, there are a lot more great horror movies out there, do not waste your time, life is too short."

I saw this adorable little satirical gem for the first time 25 years ago at the age of 16, and every year I consider myself sitting down to look at it as wasted again. It's intelligent, quirky, neat, wistful, sweet, gently subversive and absolutely adorable. The romance of these two social outsiders is both hilarious and terribly moving - more than in Maggie Smith's desperate attempt to put the right card in the deck, a scene that is both remorsefully funny and a perfect thumbnail portrait of the heartbreaking loneliness. And this last statue on the anxious, worried, affectionate face of Ustinov, when he asks: ""Everything alright?"" - Has anyone ever made the look and tone of devotion so perfect and naked honest? I would never want to know someone who did not love this movie."

It's elegant, subtle, beautiful and tragic, all rolled in two hours. This is Will Smith, when he matures into his acting skills, the whole gamut of it. Who knew? I saw The Pursuit of Happiness and thought it must be a coincidence for the blockbuster, over-the-top actor, Smith. His performances in both films show Smith a whole other dimension, a refinement of talent, scriptwriting selectivity, I'm not sure, but I see him differently now. Seven Pounds is one of those films that needs to suspend their beliefs in order to fully enjoy their essence. Do not pay attention to the action, pay attention to the fragile state of the human heart, both literally and metaphorically. It is a story of human guilt, atonement, love and sacrifice."
7,tt0368264,1,Twenty male inmates in a Kentucky prison form an unlikely Shakespearean acting troupe.,"If you want to play a play inside the prison walls, why not the best playwright William Shakespeare? And if you choose your cast from a whole range of criminals who have long punished the most vicious crimes, you can be sure that there will be enough time for rehearsals. In a prison in Kentucky, a bold project like this was undertaken with amazing results. This film shows how everything was done, the casting, the rehearsals, the set and the costumes and the final presentation of Shakespeare's play ""The Tempest"". It never crossed my mind, but there is an analogy between the game and the prison. In the game, the shipwrecked characters are limited to an island that has no contact with the outside world. Prison life is also very similar. <br /> <br /> With a simple background painted by a surrounding seascape, the characters in a very enjoyable assortment of costumes roar their lines to an approving public, not quite as Shakespeare intended, but with good heart and true sincerity , <br /> <br /> More interesting than the game itself, the little cameos of every man were behind his character. An inmate saw the game as a lesson in the forgiveness of another as a salvation of his sins. It was quite moving to see the men wiping away a tear as they talked about murder, shooting, and strangulation. Everyone felt like they would like to turn back the clock and reconsider their brutal actions. Whatever was said, the past was past and the present was the beginning of a new future. At least, the piece has given a temporary relief from the oppressive thoughts of past events. <br /> <br /> Prison authorities should be applauded for allowing the game to take place. Such an event would put Kentucky on the map and hopefully other prisons could follow their good example. It seems to me that everyone will benefit - not just Kentucky Prison, but the prisoners themselves, who will find new self-esteem and self-esteem and be prepared for the day they go to probation."

Meanwhile, the Taylors are an African-American family living in the deep South. When Willie Taylor, a minister and civil rights organizer, is shot to death, his son Emmet moves to the city and eventually joins the Black Panthers, serving as a bodyguard for Fred Hampton.","What the movie really represents the 1960s (for those of us who were snarling in America's belly at the time) is the turbulence and diversity of the decade. Despite the exaggerated, stereotypical characters, the genuineness of the themes remains clear. <br /> <br /> Not only these radical times of change, but also very confusing times. Two fundamental things changed our world at that time: the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the overwhelming influence of the media. These two new freedoms began social changes that were soon institutionalized. <br /> <br /> Out of the chaos came sensitivity, out of disorder came values. Bear in mind, however, that the majority of Americans were not involved in this ... they worked, they played, they saw the news ... and slowly they became aware of the efforts and struggles of minorities ... civil rights influenced workers, political activists, anti-war efforts, the war on poverty .... <br /> <br /> The representation of the power of the press and television in particular has been well reflected, although the conflict between the public's attitude and those who wanted to change something were at best ignored ... and misrepresented at worst. The middle-class Americans did not all stand around, annoying baseball bats or leaving their wayward daughters. They were also confused. Let's not forget how folk singers suddenly became protest singers and how the Beatles began a onslaught that killed the people's protest movement. There are no Beatle songs in the movie, or any mention of them. <br /> <br /> I think if you do not experience the decade, maybe you have no sense of what the movie is about, the whole thing The picture is a bit dark. At some point I kept a steady job while my sister lived in the Hog Farm Commune and went to Woodstock. At another point, I was in Haight Asbury and the Detroit Riots while she worked and played the housewife in Maine and Connecticut. The roles changed constantly. <br /> <br /> The film shows three siblings of a middle-class family. They represent the hippie child, political activists and active military personnel. Dad represents the typical attitudes, and mother represents the voice of reason, tolerance and sometimes compromise ... for the sake of peace. <br /> <br /> The Black family is a minister and his son ... disproportionate, in my view. I assume that the producers knew all the variables and had to limit themselves, otherwise the film would have become a long, boring documentary. Dad's message was that anger creates bitterness and bitterness creates chaos. It was clearly a message to today's youth. <br /> <br /> We are looking for a unique solution to social problems and also how to separate ourselves from ourselves ... The 60s were unusual in this way and only compare the roaring 20s. In other words, this movie has a morality after all. In the end, it is our collective individualism that survives. Put that in your oxymoron list. <br /> <br /> Everyone was a god, a guru or a free-spirited genius in the 60s. It was a time of magic and madness. Nobody will ever find the 60s right ... it was too diverse (this movie is close to it). At least we can say that we are not ashamed of having learned and born of it, and that one generation once shaped and changed America ... for the better."

Cry Me A River. I wish these were my problems. I like Dylan Baker and Sinise, but this film was clearly a bad choice or a paycheck for Sinise.

In fact, it's almost just a vehicle for Arthur Askey, one of the most popular names in the British comedy and entertainment industry for over four decades. <br /> <br /> Perhaps his incessantly happy, exuberant and essentially good-humored sense of humor will be a bit of a culture shock to many who are used to the sour and cynical taste of the British comedy of the last twenty-five years. But there are still those who appreciate his lively and cheerful persona and the total avoidance of pathos. Askey was an idol to the great Tommy Cooper, who often borrowed the ""self-strangulation"" gag with which Arthur tries to entertain the stranded passengers. <br /> <br /> There is a striking, rare appearance of the undervalued Linden Travers who acts as a mysterious Julie."
1,tt0338075,0,"There are times when it's right and proper to simply bury the dead. This is not one of those times... Gram Parsons was one of the most influential musicians of his time; a bitter, brilliant, genius who knew Elvis, tripped with the Stones and fatally overdosed on morphine and tequila in 1973. And from his dying came a story. A story from deep within folklore; a story of friendship, honour and adventure; a story so extraordinary that if it didn't really happen, no one would believe it. Two men, a hearse, a dead rock star, five gallons of petrol, and a promise. And the most extraordinary chase of modern times.","If you are a fan of the deceased Gram Parsons, this movie will definitely share you! Part comedy, part road movie, but mostly a bad fictionalization of one of the strangest stories in rock history. <br /> <br /> SPOILERS-- <br /> <br /> The story is about a well-known roadie named Phil Kaufman (played by Johnny Knoxville), who ""allegedly"" pacts with cult rock / country / folk -Music hero Gram Parsons, who explained that one of them died first (it did not matter) that the other one lived to bring the deceased to the desert, the Joshua Tree National Park in California, to be exact and setting fire to the body ... to free the mind and become one with the earth, and so on! Safe to keep his word, the barely sober Kaufman, with the help of a self-hating, pot-headed buddy, picks up the body of the deceased Parsons, who had been fatally overpowered by a drug and liquor anesthetic the day before. And shortly after, a nagging mix of fiction and truth emerges in which the late Parsons girlfriend, Kaufman's girlfriend, Parson's stone-headed dad, and a gaggle of cops and other pointless characters try to beat the clock (just to try Kaufman and his Caught buddy before they get the chance to torch Parson's body! <br /> <br /> The movie's incompetent direction, bad acting and lame unconventional tone in general sink this movie faster than the Titanic - and not to forget the fact that this movie does not even tell the truth about the actual events.The accuracies that should have replaced the inaccuracies, as far as I've heard them, are: Number 1, Parsons was married at the time of his death and even had a child So what the hell was that with the girlfriend and the hunt and what was not ?, Number 2, Kaufman's drug mate was a familiar one Terry's willing participant (as opposed to what the film tries to portray) in the elimination of Parson's body, and finally number 3. Gram Parson's real father died when he was a boy, and so it was Parsons stepfather (who, to be honest less able to take care of Gram Parsons when he was alive) in real life, who took care of the body after it was lit! All in all, though, it's probably bothering me the most that the real Phil Kaufman was on set to help with the facts of the story. And yet, the film was so untrue and so bad that it really blew me away! <br /> <br /> Also, the mediocre act of acting mentioned above in the movie concerns its main character, played by the ultra-raging Johnny Knoxville (Phil Kaufman), is not only a bad actor, but it actually seems to be so for the most part The movie's asleep, and the rest of the miserable cast is mostly either hysterical, brain dead, or seems completely unaware of what they're doing there at all! All in all, if you like Johnny Knoxville or really the bad ones - they're not good-punk movies - then I guess you might get a kick out of this movie! But if you're like me and a fan of the deceased Gram Parsons, then you enjoy watching movies that try to tell the truth as well as possible, especially if they're based on an actual real story and or just like good movies, road movies or fictional slice-of-life stuff, you'll really detest this movie and advise others to do it as well. I obviously hated this movie and wished it had never been done, but since it was made, I would rather have done it differently than it unfortunately did! Maybe one day, the true facts of the story will come through and become a really great biopic about the life of Gram Parsons ... not just what happened to his body after his mind left. But until then, all we get as audiences and / or fans of the late performer is this sad waste of film and an all-encompassing terrible monument to the musical legacy Gram Parsons has left behind. It should also be noted that they have actually used Parsons music and a few others in the movie, but not surprisingly, you never hear enough of it to enjoy it in the least. (Turkey-zero stars)"

This film was 0 for 4 at the Academy Awards and was not even nominated for the best picture, while Dr. Doolittle was. Imagine that! <br /> <br /> Although you do not know the Clutter family as well as you do in the book, it was a good decision to focus more on Perry and Dick and follow the process of tracking down these guys Low.

Well, this movie will not give answers to this common question - but it will provide an excellent case study. <br /> <br /> From the very beginning, this film acts as a kind of ""old school"" for Pacific New Zealanders. This immediately raises the question of what exactly the purpose of such a task is. Is it intended to maintain deep-rooted stereotypes of Pacific Island New Zealanders? or should this potential market be used? The story is weak, jokes humorlessly, and the ending is expected.

It made Novak a big star, put a nice article in Jack Lemon's CV, shed new light on Jimmy Stewart and gave Lancaster and Gingold new ways to discover their careers (both still playing witches and other curious ""old bats""), in film and television). <br /> <br /> Together with the 40s movie ""I married a witch"" (which helped make Veronica Lake an icon), Bell, Book and Candle inspired the fascination of film and television with sorcery started and was continued by practical magic, worst witch and Harry Potter. <br /> <br /> What I rarely notice is that the movie is also a pretty interesting alternative Christmas movie. The story takes place during the Christmas holidays, and although she acts superficially about witchcraft, she actually embodies a lot of Christmas spirit (giving, love, family, self-sacrifice, etc.). <br /> <br /> I'll always see this movie (I've seen it several times since my first performance in the early '90s), especially when it's shown around or right after Christmas.

But when Lewis is brutally murdered, Bobby must investigate the mysterious Fan Yu temple, where he must enter an underground pagoda and face off with the most terrifying of enemies.","There are so many silly moments in ""Tower of Death"" / ""Game of Death 2"" that you really wonder if it's a spoof. Sometimes it felt like I saw a sequel to Kung Pow rather than a Bruce Lee movie. <br /> <br /> To be honest, this movie has everything to do with ""Game of Death"". If anything, it's more of a sequel / remake of ""Enter the Dragon,"" which contains many elements of this movie - especially the actual footage. Bruce Lee's character Billy Lo (apparently) examines his friend's sudden death and encounters a piece of film left behind by the man's daughter. When the body is stolen during the funeral (!), Billy is also killed and it is up to his idiosyncratic brother to avenge the death of both men. <br /> <br /> Tong Long plays as Brother Bobby Lo and does not really have the kind of charisma to wear the movie. His fighting skills are very good though. Obviously, thanks to (no more) deleted footage, Bruce Lee simply comes to pay for the legacy. On the whole, the footage is actually better edited than in ""Game of Death,"" but it does not stop the film from getting mixed up. <br /> <br /> OK, so the fights are really entertaining (I dare to say overwhelming) and make the movie worth seeing. But there are so many stupid elements in this movie that it really tests your patience. First of all, there is the alleged villain who lives on his palatial estate ... or is this spiritual institution? Seriously, the hooker eats raw game, drinks deer blood, carries a monkey on his shoulder and has some peacocks and lions (?!). This attempt to make him look tough and intelligent only makes him feel sorry for him - one almost expects someone to accompany him back to his room. <br /> <br /> In fact, this middle section is awful and when the scene came with a nude hooker and a lion suit, I turned it off. But I finished the movie and was kind of glad that I did that because the fight scene towards the end (much like 'GOD') was the whole reason for the reputation. While the story is an embarrassment, the plot is very good and contains excellent choreography. <br /> <br /> But even the final disappointed when the premise is something. We were told that the ""Tower of Death"" is a pagoda that is upside down and underground. That sounded great as if Bruce Lee's original idea was being reinterpreted with different fighting styles on every level. Could this be the ""Game of Death"" originally planned? No! The movie should have been called ""Generator Room of Death"", because as far as the tower goes. Yes, there were actually one or two ""different"" styles ... there were foil-clad grunts, leopard-skinned and stupid monks. It's as if Enter the Dragon was never done, because the plot is a bad imitation. <br /> <br /> It's worth watching the fast-paced battle scenes, but sometimes so stupid that it hurts. If that was intended, then fine. Thumbs up to recreate this projector room scene from ""Enter The Dragon""."

It's my top 2 favorite movie of all time, other world futuristic and psycho-thriller. The intensity of the root material (Shakespeare's ""The Tempest"") is not overshadowed by Whizbang gimmicks (a la Lucas). And just because it was made in 1956, you can not assume that you can see the threads that hold the flying saucer. This was the first movie you did NOT want to do. Miracle that it was made in ""A-movie"" scale, economy and taste at the time were heavily stacked against it. And director Wilcox's last hit was ""Lassie Come Home."" Until I looked up, I assumed that Fred Wilcox was a pseudonym for a director who became famous, or later, but at that time he did not want to be associated with sci-fi, which was strictly a ""B"" genre back then. This was either a VERY VERY visionary production or a very random ""mistake"" on the part of people getting Hollywood rolling. <br /> <br /> There are the massive scale mats with live action almost microscopically inserted, which Lucas uses extensively. There are intelligent machines that go beyond the stereotypical ""user interface""; ""Computers"", as they are presented in later works much less futuristic. Star Trek 'Transporter' is visual, almost unchanged by Roddenberry 10 years later. And if the Technobabble from Trek / Wars scares you off, the scientific references of FP are not exaggerated and are still correct today. The ""Ship"" set is comprehensive, sparklingly realistic, pretty much everything you've seen since, and more convincing than anything Trek has done for TV or film. We did not spend as much time there as I would have liked. <br /> <br /> If you've ever wondered how movies got so competent into space, FP will explain everything to you. It's definitely not 'Wagontrain to the Stars'."

""Police Python 357"" is a good example of how Corneau designed and shot his works at this time of his career. They had an excellent cinematography, meticulous scripts, and a polished direction that was created for the sake of efficiency. <br /> <br /> Police Superintendent Ferrot (Yves Montand) is an out-of-the-box policeman who normally works all by himself. He becomes acquainted with a young woman Sylvia Léopardi (Stefania Sandrelli) and becomes her lover, while ignoring that she has another lover: his superior Ganay (François Périer). When the latter finds out, he kills her in a tantrum. Ferrot has to investigate the murder and all the clues are inexorable against him ... <br /> <br /> You'd think that this kind of far-fetched story is not exempt from mishaps and sometimes you can see through it but Corneau's pedantic directorial style helps to conjure up a suffocating, gloomy atmosphere. The first part of the movie before the murder night may seem uninteresting, but it is crucial to what will follow this key moment. Corneau resorts to a sober treatment with rather sparse moments and short appearances of secondary characters, which the viewer will see again during the examination. Corneau and his scriptwriter Daniel Boulanger have written a clever story despite all the disadvantages.

He is a cop who gradually loses his identity and finds himself in the midst of a terrible depersonalization. It is embodied by the moment he throws acid on his face so that witnesses will not recognize him when confronted with them. <br /> <br /> The backdrop of this thriller, Orléans, is efficiently enhanced by Corneau's camera, helping to inspire this sinister thriller with its ruinous charm."

The great freedoms of the United States are no longer, as the once great nation has sealed off its borders and become a militarized police state, censoring all film, art, literature, and communications. Even so, a small resistance force led by two revolutionaries manages to fight the oppression. With full control over the media, the government attempts to quell the nation's yearning for freedom by broadcasting a number of game shows on which convicted criminals fight for their lives. The most popular and sadistic of these programs is ""The Running Man,"" hosted by Damon Killian. When a peaceful protest of starving citizens gathers in Bakersfield, California, a police officer named Ben Richards is ordered to fire on the crowd, which he refuses to do. Subdued by the other officers, the attack is carried out, and Richards is framed for the murder of almost a hundred unarmed civilians.

This film never had a chance because of the casting, but maybe people can now see why I felt that way when leaving the theater. Only ""wargames"" left me similarly distraught as I left the theater with the feeling of glancing at our future. History has shown that's exactly what happened. <br /> <br /> Casting is a pop culture 1980s Cuisinart: you get Arnold as Ben Richards, the framed refugee who had the chance to ""run"" for his freedom in the game show with the same title as the movie ; Richard Dawson as Damon Killian, treating his role as if he were the host of the family feud, with the fighters using real weapons; Jesse Ventura as ""Captain Freedom"" and co-wrestler Professor Tanaka as ""Subzero"", both ""stalkers"" who kill the ""running men"". Even Mick Fleetwood (Mic) and Dweezil Zappa (Stevie) appear, while the ""Dancers of the Future"" are nothing but the Laker Girls. This movie SCREAMS ""80s."" The plot is a good excuse for the action: Ben Richards is determined to prove his innocence, but agrees to be the Running Man when told that his friends would be released; Instead, they join him as a ""candidate"". Maria Conchita Alonzo as Amber Mendez is the benchmark for judging Salma Hayek in the 1990s. <br /> <br /> The production value on the film was a bit meager, the lines were cheesy and (at the time), the plot seemed a bit far-fetched. I remember leaving the theater thinking that we would definitely go in the direction of the movie, but who could have seen how far we went there and how fast? If The Running Man were listed in TV Guide, most people would think that it was just another reality show breaking through the envelope today. The government's influence on the media has only worsened, and the stultified American public of the future, which reveals all its freedoms for ""national security"", is downright frightening. Ben Richards is brilliantly played by Arnold as one of the few remaining holdouts against a government tyranny that the rest of America is too willing to accept in return for good television and some farewell gifts for the public. <br /> <br /> The movie was way over the top, maybe even off the cliff for its time, but like Back to the Future III, the ""gorge"" it seemed to sink into in 1987 became 2006 and later replaced by completed tracks This movie will sail into the future as one of the more prophetic films of our time. It's tragic that the Academy, like Wargames, did not give this brilliant script the credit it deserved. ""Serious"" actors who act seriously while being so arrogant that they want to surrender may win more Oscars, but that does not make them better movies than their ""usual"" counterparts like these. <br /> <br /> An absolute must."

Shortly after Toots and May arrive in London to visit with their grown children Bobby and Paula and their respective children, Toots falls ill and dies. Toots' death brings to the surface the underlying strain that has always existed between May and both of her two children, and the unhappy lives they have all led. Now specifically with Paula, May is disapproving of her relationship with a construction worker named Darren. Not only does May think his occupation makes him beneath Paula, he's also a married man. Darren is in an unsatisfying marriage but doesn't want to leave it if only because of his son. Even after May gets to know and like Darren, she still encourages Paula to break up with him. The issue is that May herself has fallen in love with Darren, the two who begin a sexual relationship. What will ultimately happen between May and Darren also depends on Darren, who is floundering in his own life and doesn't...","While movie titles include the word ""mother,"" the first thing that comes to mind is the mother's love for her children. <br /> <br /> However, the mother tells a different story. <br /> <br /> The mother does not discuss the love between a mother and her child or how she sacrifices herself for the benefit of her child. Here Notting Hill director Roger Michell tells how a mother's love for a man about half her age hurts the people around her. <br /> <br /> Before taking on the role of James Bond, Daniel Craig plays Darren, a man who helps renovate the mother's son's house and sleep with her daughter as well. Anne Reid, who has been a familiar face in TV series, takes on the challenging role of the main character May. <br /> <br /> The story begins with May's sudden loss of her husband Toots on a family visit to her son, Bobby. While she befriends Darren, a craftsman who is being renovated in Bobby's house, she was shocked to discover that her daughter Paula slept with Darren. At the same time, May was done with the afterlife of Toots. Fearing that Harry and Paula will not have her, May starts losing her life until she spends her afternoon with Darren. <br /> <br /> Darren was nice and friendly to May and May soon finds affection for Darren. Instead of treating him like a friend, she treated the man, who was about half the age of a couple. Later, May found sexual satisfaction with Darren, where he gave her the pleasure she could never otherwise find. And this is the beginning of the catastrophe that could lead to the collapse of a family. <br /> <br /> The mother explores the inner world of a widow who wanted to try something she never had in her life and comforting someone who is there to shoulder her. This may be said in May to buy tea snacks for Darren to meet the sexual needs of a man younger than her, where she eventually gave more than she expected. <br /> <br /> Anne Reid has made a breakthrough for her role of May, as she was previously best known for her various roles in television series. Since she does not have many films in her career CV, the mother has made her aware of the criticism. Daniel Craig, on the other hand, had played a similar role in his film career as Sylvia (2003) and Enduring Love (2004). If his role as James Bond fails, film critics should not forget that he has performed better in small film productions during his years as a film-maker. The mother is one of them. <br /> <br /> The mother is not everyone's favorite, but it's definitely not your usual matinée show with tea and scones, accompanied by butter and jam."

It is here that he meets the fairy Aisling, a mysterious young wolf-girl, who helps him along the way. But with the barbarians closing in, will Brendan's determination and artistic vision illuminate the darkness and show that enlightenment is the best fortification against evil?","While watching this movie, I was frustrated and distracted and at the end I wanted to give the film a solid 4 or 5. I thought the animation was random and everywhere and there was too much going on. Even my A.D.D could not keep up. It felt like a light sour journey. Everything looked flat, for all there was no dimension. There were so many shapes, lines and patterns. I really wanted to stop the movie halfway and smash my burnt copy of this movie. But after I looked at it, I went online to read the movie, and I should have investigated a bit before watching the video. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kells is loosely based on the true story of Kells' original book. A little boy, Brendan, has the task of writing new pages in the book, which is considered the best book of all time. This book contains information that helps to ""turn darkness into light."" Brendan lives in the village of Kells behind huge stone walls. Brendan's uncle, the abbot of Kells, tries to build the wall in the 8th century to keep the Vikings out. Brendan's uncle insists he helps to complete the wall, but a traveler and guardian of the ""book"" secretly trains Brendan to improve his illustration skills, persuading him to ""complete the book"" and execute his word. <br /> <During the whole time I watched the movie, I thought I missed something because I did not really understand what was going on. I thought I just missed a bit of Irish history. A simple Google search taught me everything I needed to know about the original Book of Kells. After reading many articles, my opinion about the film changed a lot. <br /> <br /> The Kells book is a copied version of the first few New Testament books transcribed into Latin by Irish monks in Ireland in the 8th century. Along with its palaeographical and insular writing, the book is also beautifully illustrated in Island Art, a kind of early art form known for its complexity, complexity and miniature illustrations. Much of the art in the Book of Kells is presented in the same way that many artworks were flat and dimensionally challenged at the time, with no perspective. But what differentiates the Book of Kells from other early works of art is the use of many colors. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kells is very colorful. I originally thought the animation was flat and boring. It reminded me a lot of the cartoon Samurai Jack, who also had a flat and ""amine"" look. Once I've learned about the art styles of the Book of Kells, it's obvious that many of the styles in the book are imitated in the film. There are lines and whirls and various shapes that inhabit Brendan's opinion. When he enters his imagination, circular shapes resembling the sun, cogs, clocks, and wheels fill the screen. The edges of the screen are framed in decorated, moving triangles or circles. Transitions are filled with color and Celtic knots. From the trees to the floors, many things in this world are covered in shapes or patterns. <br /> <br /> The secret of Kells is 70 minutes without credits. It's a funny little history class with a little adventure and stupidity to interest people (maybe just kids). I think you have to generally fall back on the mystery of Kells as a half-art piece, half-film about history. Although it looks like it was animated with Adobe Illustrator, it's a very good-looking movie. But based on the 20 films submitted for Oscar, I do not think it's worth nominating over Mary and Max. <br /> <br /> ThatWasJunk.Blogspot.com"

There seems to be a tendency today to label and market every black-and-white B film from 1947 to 1955 as Noir, and the label does not always fit. There is a persecuted male protagonist, Ed Cullen (Lee J. Cobb), and most of the plot of the movie takes place in the house. These are just the only Noir elements I could see. There is no omnipresent paranoia or any real reason why you should sympathize with Ed Cullen. Jane Wyatt was exaggerated and unconvincing as Femme Fatale.

Instead, what he got was a talented group of circus performers. But when the grasshoppers return and take control of the island, Flik must prove himself a true hero before it's too late.","Lately, I've seen a lot of movies by Tom Hanks and old Chaplin movies, and even some of Rowan Atkinson's early bean performances, and it seems that all of them have their unique charm that permeates them, something they relate to Can identify viewers of all ages, in a way that just does you good. A Bug's Life has the same charm, it has a connection with real life that allows us to easily lift unbelief and accept many talking insects because even though they talk, they still act like real bugs. It's as if the team that made the film found a way to put us in the head of a child and allow us to think, to imagine bugs, like a young mind does. <br /> <br /> Darling, I've Shrunk The Kids was one of my favorite movies when I was younger, and to me A Bug's Life is like a more realistic version of the movie, just because the animation is so breathtaking and this type of storytelling simply so many opens up more narrative possibilities. I'm not trying to compare it to something like Toy Story (which I still claim is the best computer-animated movie of all time) because the story of A Bug's Life is not as good as Toy Story, but almost nothing. The important thing is that it's still a lot of fun. <br /> <br /> The story is about a colony of hard-working bugs that have an impressively developed society that is primarily geared towards building a crop of food, most of which goes to the tyrannical grasshoppers that are in power and wickedness are far superior and hopefully enough left for the beetles to make it through the winter. We are visited by grasshopper visits, which make it clear that if the beetles provide an insufficient amount of food, the consequences will be bleak. And by the way, the similarities between this crippling level of food extraction is strikingly similar to Mao Tse-tung's malign enforcement of food from his own people during the ""Big Leap Forward"". <br /> <br /> The fun and excitement begin as Flik, ​​the main character, sets out to find a band of suitable warrior bugs to come back and defend the colony against the grasshoppers. You see, he spilled all the food and put everyone in great danger, so he feels it's his responsibility, but he ends up inadvertently hiring a fighting group of insect circus performers. Great for the audience, not great for the security of the clan. <br /> <br /> The film was released in the late '90s when so many films appeared in pairs, such as Armageddon and Deep Impact, Independence Day and The Arrival, A Bug's Life and Antz, etc comparisons between A Bug's Life and Antz are inevitable, though it seems clear to me that A Bug's Life is by far the most superior movie, and not just because Woody Allen is not stuttering and whining through the lead role. This is great family fun!"
7,tt0081076,1,"Maurice Pialat's portrait of contemporary France mocks prosperity as a substitute for social and sexual revolution. Nelly abandons her bourgeois friends and a steady relationship for the unemployed layabout Loulou, whose charms include focusing his energy into sex.","This is a pretty dull movie. Well shot with realistic performances, especially a very good one by Depardieu as cad and bad boy with realistic location mood and art-house connotations everywhere, it fails because the director does not take a position, attitude or critical comment on the subject he has given. One of France's revered and regular workers in films with Depardieu - I think they did 7 together - Pialat failed. It seems to be a treatise on why women fall in love with the bad boy who gets hurt if they have a caring friend and a kindhearted husband. Isabelle Hupert, who plays the womanizer with nonchalant distinction, offers shameful answers like ""I do not know""; ""I like his arms""; ""I like the way he makes love"" to her questioning husband, who tries to kick her out of the house, but relieves and thinks over, because ... I suppose he loves her. So he accepts and hopes for something? That she will one day wake up and come to her senses. Such things are not answered in Pialat's condescending docu-drama style with long speeches and even longer scenes that do not add up. I know the answers are not correct, but please comment. Jules and Jim, that's not it. The last shot, as cold as the movie we just saw, is a heartache and a headache only for the most outrageous."

His charming musical became a hit in New York and around the world. The film was made in the summer of 1967 in England and then published in 1968. The sets and musical numbers are insane.

In 1955, Bettie Page (1923-2008 ) waits to testify before a Senate subcommittee investigating the effects of pornographic material on American adolescents and juveniles. In flashbacks, we see her childhood in Tennessee, a brief marriage, a gang rape, and her going to New York City in 1949. There she takes acting lessons, models for photos, and acts in short films for adults, earning the nickname, ""The Pin-Up Queen of the Universe."" We see her relationship with merchants Irving and Paula Klaw, photographers John Willie and Bunny Yeager, boyfriends, and the public. Through it all, she is wholesome, sporting, and forthright - Eve before the fall.","THE SPECIAL BEDDY PAGE (2006) *** 1/2 Gretchen Mol, Lilli Taylor, Chris Bauer, Jared Harris, Sarah Paulson, David Strathairn, Austin Pendleton, Norman Reedus, Dallas Roberts. <br /> <br /> Mol appears as a legendary pinup queen Bettie Page in a fine biopic. <br /> <br /> Gretchen Mol has been known to be reprimanded as The Next-It-Girl a few years ago, especially when no-one knew who she was, despite a notorious cover story by Vanity Fair among other media -Dubbings, but despite some co-starring here and there, her predicted fame seemed even less bright. Here, like the famous pin-up queen Bettie Page, Gretchen Mol is indeed a shining star on the rise. <br /> <br /> Bettie Page was born in Tennessee as a God-fearing and family-oriented, real girl herself the unjustified object of lust and affection as she grew older. A criminal gang rape is not graphically portrayed, and even the subtle portrayal of her own father has not quite as good designs for his own relatives, which is important to understand how Page mysterious life for a career could escape an actress who Traveling to New York City in the 1950s, in fact, was the time and place to catch the lights in a bottle. What Page did not know was that it was exactly when she arrived. <br /> <br /> A beautiful, raven-black treasure with a divine figure. Page is seen by a black policeman on a summer's day on Coney Island with a request to take her picture, causing her to pose in his basement and finally to the studios of Irving Klaw (Bauer) and his sister Paula (Taylor) who devote their kitschy yet pornographic stills to a unique clientele: fetish types. <br /> Although Page is pretty naïve, she is undeniably smart and knows that her body is not a sin and can see the forest for the trees in the sense that she is in control - or at least sticking with what you do is offered to work that it is not indecent and she amused herself in her increasingly understated portraits - until a witch hunt in Congress is looking for some scapegoats to make pornographic images a crime. <br /> <br /> The talented filmmaker Mary Harron and her screenwriting partner Guinevere Turner (""An American Psycho"" and ""I Shot Andy Warhol"") streamline biopic productions quite neatly and perhaps a bit premature to be who they really are was Bettie Page, though they do justice to represent a time of tension in their zenith. A big thank you goes to the gifted cameraman Mott Hopfel for his black-and-white images and speckled color segments reminiscent of Douglas Sirk films reminiscent of melodramatic lighters. Part Feminist Contract and Part American Dream made the story chug beautifully with fine performances by his ensemble including comic peasant and Taylor as siblings in Dirt and Harris with a field day as colleagues fotog with a taste for wine and chatter. It is amusing to see Strathairn as a senator in a campaign for justice, after portraying New Bulldog Edward R. Murrow on his recent excursion ""Good Night and Good Luck"" as a counterpart to the table role. > <br /> But beware of the truly fine talents of Mol as the uninhibited, but deeply moral and, above all, intelligent Bettie Page, who lets her childlike innocence shine through her bold nudity and now considers it tame and hilarious. Borderline kitschy poses that have been holding man's imagination captive for decades and are still a bookmark for human sexuality in this country and perhaps the world. Mol is perfect and eerily resembles the theme of her portrait to her knowing-whimsical smile. The real Bettie Page was allegedly not involved in the project, but apparently she gave her blessing and continues to live a secluded life that is alluded to in the final moments that she found Jesus and repulsed her ""infamous"" image once and for all. A shame, since this film strangely embraces and exudes the piercing decency that has infiltrated its theme that all can see in its naked splendor."

I discount the comments of others, if the real opera singers are older and heavier. <br /> <br /> As beautiful as Ms. Loren was at the age of 19 and still is today, the movie would have been shot better than even though it was played on stage. After all, we do not see any beautiful young people singing on stage with ""old opera singers"" behind the scenes behind the curtain! Do not be shy about the success of using heavy opera singers. All you need to do is refer to the most artistically produced commercial for the J. G. Wentworth Company, where the opera singers on stage so professionally sing the praise of the company's product. This is one of the best and most entertaining TV commercials ever produced. <br /> <br /> The quality of film printing also makes this production a little worse. The color ink has faded a lot and that can not be helped. <br /> <br /> To improve this movie on DVD, the production company should add English subtitles so that we, who do not speak Italian, can know what the text is saying. It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator 30 seconds introduction to the scenes. <br /> <br /> Do not watch this movie because of the story of Aida or the fact that this is an opera.

But nothing on earth can save you if your script is boring. Thumbs down! <br /> <br /> Performances: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor. But how could he fix such a role? Akshay Kumar is a great actor, in fact he is the only saving grace. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. She looks gorgeous and leaves you, everyone gets up. Saif Ali Khan is not due here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted. <br /> <br /> 'Tashan' is a boring movie. The film fails at the box office, you should keep away."

Meanwhile, he falls in love with inept secretary and frustrated flutist, Maggie Smith.","A good cast is horribly wasted in this slow comedy chased more than molly and arbitrarily. Peter Ustinov is trying to bring something to life, but the result is a boring boredom that misses all the right beats that might have made it look like. Despite the positive comments here, this movie is awful. Badly directed. Badly edited. Bad act. Badly written. You have to sit through a hundred films to find such a bad one. <br /> <br /> The confused and torturous latecomer action employs Ustinov's way into an American insurance company to hack their computer and embezzle millions of pounds. How he does it is beyond lameness and credibility (he learns his computer skills only seemingly overnight by reading some pamphlets, and seduces computer expert Robert Morley to go to South America and steal his identity). <br /> <br /> Subplot, Ustinov romance colleague longtime Maggie Smith, who happens to be his secretary after he gets an apartment in her building. In the end, she shares scenes of sexual undertones with Bob Newhart, who lead nowhere, while Ustinov finishes the money piece by piece, trying to stay one step ahead of Newhart and Karl Malden. Then he marries Smith and they fly to Brazil, which since then (Nuns on the Run? A fish called Wanda?) Has become the staple of almost every British comedy. <br /> <br /> The surprising turn of an end is more ridiculous than anything that came before. In the end, I thought I really must be away from my rocker to do such a banter. Even a cameo by Cesar Romero did not help him. One of the most unmotivated, low-profile ""comedies"" I've ever seen, and certainly the worst caper game. Do not waste time. If you love that, you have to watch better movies."

The people of a nearby small town refuse to listen to some teenagers who have witnessed the blob's destructive power. In the meantime, the blob just keeps on getting bigger.","THE BLOB is a great horror movie, not only because of the vivid images of its almost unstoppable, carnivorous title character, but because it contains a true social message. It's a ""feel-good horror movie"" in many ways. The clever story is immensely helped by solid performances of the entire cast. The two romantic leads Steve McQueen and Aneta Corsaut bring surprising depth and sentimentality into the action. They are misunderstood, but very well meaning young people, and it is very easy to root for them. <br /> <br /> This is a pro-society movie, and its youthful delinquent characters cause boredom, not some kind of malicious character flaw. Steve McQueen's drag racing rival seems almost an enemy at the beginning of the game, but quickly joins McQueen's campaign to save the city from the seeping intruder as soon as he sees McQueen's seriousness. In this way, a character situation that initially appears cartoon-like suddenly develops depth and human realism. <br /> <br /> The authorities' initial skepticism about the wild claims of children proves to be wrong - and once the threat is recognized by all, all conflicts within society disappear. This unification of purpose and affirmation of the ""troublemakers"" becomes official when Aneta Corsaut's father breaks into the school to obtain the fire extinguishers needed to freeze the blob. On any other day, breaking into the school is considered vandalism typical of a juvenile delinquent - on this day it is a necessary action performed by an adult authority figure. At this turning point it is clear that there are no dividing lines between young and old. <br /> <br /> This is an unusual film that recognizes the perception of a ""generational gap,"" but suggests it is more imaginary than real, and given a real crisis, people will naturally band together to restore order , ""The Blob"" is a perfect tonic for the kind of depression that usually accompanies a consideration of ""Night of the Living Dead"" (1968). <br /> <br /> Much of the cheap but innovative movie has been made (and effectively!) visual effects. You are undeniably smart. A lot of the gravity-tricking tricks we see performing the blob were achieved with miniature sets designed to be turned. The camera was usually attached very tightly to the sets (the lights had to be similarly mounted so that the lighting remained stable as the room was rotated in this and that way). These scenes were often photographed one picture at a time as the room was slowly turned - the silicon drop trickled very slowly and his action had to be accelerated. In a way, this was similar to stop-motion photography, but using a dab of silicone instead of a dumbbell. To date, the effects are surprising and bizarre. <br /> <br /> A very good movie with an exploitative title, THE BLOB is a must."

Edie is voluble, dresses - as she puts it - for combat in tight ensembles that include scarves wrapped around her head. There are hints that Edie came home 24 years before to be cared for rather than to care for her mother.

They're odd, with flinty affection for each other.","Hey, well, you, TheatreX, thought so while I was scouring videos at the flea market in near-new condition, and when I read the back of the box, I saw that it was a ""cult hit,"" so of course came home me. <br /> <br /> What a strange movie. Aunt and cousin of former First Lady Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis lives in this dilapidated 28-room house on Long Island (Suffolk Co.) and shares the house with raccoons, cats, fleas (eyow!) And who knows what else. Suffolk Co. was at a point above them because they lived in filth, and old Jackie herself came by to fix things. Anyway, this is a weird couple, Big Edie and Little Edie ... Edie (the daughter) always wears something over her head and dances, sings and gives the camera little things that rarely make much sense. Big Edie (the 79-year-old mother) seems to like walking around naked, and while we're getting clues as to what that might look like, fortunately, that has been made so tasty (?) That it's mercifully spared us. These women talk and talk and talk mainly about the past, and it does not make much sense except to them. They live in absolute filth, cats do their business everywhere (""Look, this cat is going to the bathroom behind my portrait!""), And a bedroom seems to be their work center. Closing my eyes and hearing Big Edie's voice reminds me a lot of my own deceased aunt, who came from that part of the country and had that Lawn Guyland accent. In one scene, Little Edie put on flea repellent, nice, you can see the cats scratching all the time, so the place has to be infested. The box refers to these two women as ""eccentric,"" and I would say, in this case, it's just a euphemism for ""being thrown out of their pumpkins,"" but this movie is not without moments where you really feel something. This is equally scary, sad and disgusting, but I could not stop looking when I started. This is not my ""normal"" type of strip, but I found it a bit intriguing.

Moments of black comedy intersperse this aggressive, adult drama, with adult language, and extreme violence.","Now I have read some negative reviews for this show on this website and frankly I am appalled. For anyone who thinks the sopranos are not television, I'm afraid I do not know what the world has come to. Let me tell you something. I started seeing many TV shows like Lost, Prison Break, Dexter, Deadwood and even Invasion. But all those shows have lost their character after the first season, especially Lost and Prison Break, which I do not want to see because the companies took two brilliant ideas and slaughtered them by doing more than one season. Then we have the sopranos. I can honestly say that this is the only television series I have ever seen where I was thrilled in all its season and especially in all episodes. There is no department where this show is not unique. Acting - Nothing less than great. James Gandolfini is one of my favorite actors and I think his acting is absolutely stunning in every episode. After hearing that HBO wanted Ray Liotta to play Tony, I felt that it would have been a better choice after watching the first episodes, I knew that HBO had done a great job of throwing James as Tony. The raw emotion he shows is outstanding. Then we have everyone else, Edie Falco, Michael Imperioli, Lorraine Bracco, Dominic Chianese (whom I remember as Johnny Ola in Godfather Part 2) and my personal favorite characters Tony Sirico and Steve Van Zandt Paulie Walnut Gualtieri and Silvio Dante. All these perform the best quality and perform excellently in each episode. Then we have the story, never before was I so sucked into a TV show. The story is nothing less than excellent. Every episode is great and the score of this show is just fantastic. I think that The Sopranos is a show that I can see again and again and that I'm never bored with. It has everything from hilarious humor to brutal violence, but nonetheless it is and always will be the best thing that sets the television apart, and I challenge everyone to find a real flaw in the show. I mean, it's a mafia show at the end of the day, I do not think the characters will be very honest or loyal to God. I implore everyone to watch this show because believe me, you will be addicted from the first episode, I was and I even got some friends who at first refused to see the show, addicted to it. Trust me when I say that this show is a godsend compared to the crap that comes on TV. After watching the first season, you'll inevitably agree with me when I say again that this show dominates television and no TV show present or future will surprise the wonder that the sopranos are."

How will Ben convince the crotchety old comedians to put aside their differences before the big show?","Walter Matthau and George Burns were a famous variety comedy, Lewis and Clark, who have not spoken for over 10 years. Burns retired and Matthau took it personally and has since expressed a grudge. This is the premise of this fun Neil Simon play that was made into a movie. What makes it so good of course is Matthau and Burns in their prime, and the material is funnier than anything you can find today. Richard Benjamin appears as Matthaus nephew and agent. There are even old clips from current stars of the Golden Age to get you into the groove of the movie, and character-actor Fritz Feld starts everything with a ""pop."" Rosetta LaNoire, who went to the theater with Orson Welles in the thirties and later became a grandmother on ""Family Matters"", is great in a small role. <br /> <br /> The only problem I had with it (and maybe I'm too picky and / or serious) is the way Matthau treats Burns when they first meet. Granted, he's been in a lot of trouble all these years, but some of the things he does would be considered rude or simply bad manners taken out of context. Besides, I'm used to Matthau's behavior in other films, but not with George Burns. And Matthau's roar tends to get a bit old. <br /> <br /> All in all, if you need a thoroughly funny movie to help and forget about your problems, put in ""The Sunshine Boys"". They will lift your spirits and make you think of a simpler time and way of life. <br /> <br /> Benjamin: ""You have to push it."" <br /> <br /> Matthau: ""Wait, wait, I think you have to push it."""

The genius brought to us by Hiroshima Mon Amour takes on the challenge of making a French musical of the 1930s in vibrant colors. The introduction with old, embellished inter-titles was a nice touch. Then the camera opening (like the old crank handles) opens on a black and white poster. The camera steps back (or rather, up) and suddenly shows us the surprisingly brilliant colors of an elegant table set for a tea party. That's all in the first 60 seconds. <br /> <br /> Then the music starts. A rather banal and forgetful Diddy with an unconvincing chorus of three girls blabbering some nonsense that's not relevant to the movie (and yes, I speak French, so I can not blame the subtitles). These characters whiz out the door and are replaced by more people breaking into an even more forgotten song. Then they go, and finally Audrey Tautou appears and we hear our first noteworthy dialogue 15 minutes after the movie. <br /> <br /> I am not sure what Resnais has intended with such a yawning waste of time and musicality cacophony. The effect on the viewer, however, is that you want to throw Skittles on the screen and storm out. I could stand it. <br /> <br /> It did not get much better. I will tell you why. There is absolutely no familiarity with any characters. We do not even see their faces half the time (because Resnais is too eager to show the expensive landscape to take care of the people in front of the camera). People are pacing up and down like moths around a lamp, and we viewers are unable to focus on a particular person or action. It's like taking every episode of Brady Bunch and stuffing it into a two-hour movie. With bad songs. <br /> <br /> The only thing that kept me watching (1 hour) was that I looked at the camera techniques, the lighting and the scenery, all of which, admittedly, were excellent. But is that enough to keep your attention for 2 hours? Not me. Maybe tomorrow I will try to watch the end. Oh, who am I doing? I have more important things to do. I'm sure you do too. Skip this."

The film spends its time showing how powerless the most visible black in it is (except for a heroic moment). For much of the film, the other black men (and dark-skinned black women) in the film are far in the background, barely visible. <br /> <br /> Vanessa Williams's character was strong and sympathetic. The viewer can easily identify them and sympathize with them. There are also some pretty visible and three-dimensional supportive figures that are fair-skinned, and some white characters of some warmth and dignity.

It was probably too racy for television - which contributed to the mix with drugs and hippies - that NBC initially refused to air it, and so this low budget hit the cinemas. Director James Goldstone goes crazy with the hyperkinetic visuals and tracking shots while the editor edits Edward A. Biery with the zig-zag cuts. Unfortunately, their admittedly colorful gimmicks can not cover up the weaknesses of this updated storyline, and the acting is sadly overripe. Dillman, under pressure to remember the events of the night in question, goes through an actor's seminar of tics, stuttering, noses and crazy half-laughter as he spits out dialogues like ""Dream ... a dream ... drugs ... yes ""Drugs ...

Is he braked so hard that he has to throw out trash and hopes his call will carry him through the movie? Chuck is a great martial artist, and as we've seen by Walker, Texas Ranger, a pretty good actor, the trick is to combine those two qualities in his films, and this one is not. Very disappointing for us Norris fans. Chuck, stay a main character in your movies, because that does not work for you ... Gary"

Like many others before him, it portrays more of the mythology of the Alamo than history. The production is poor, overall the impression of a welfare project for many actors who would have otherwise work on Hollywood Squares. That was the biggest blemish for me - I know the ages and the generalities of the true Alamo protagonists, and the geriatric ensemble of television actors selected to portray them never gave a touch of credibility. <br /> <br /> As a native Texan, I grew up with mythology. I learned more about the story later. I can accept decent production from any perspective (although I prefer more historical accuracy), but this never gave me a chance to enjoy it. Even John Waynes or Fess Parker's versions had more lives than this proud mess, while they were just slightly inaccurate. <br /> <br /> Very disappointing - avoid it."

The blood is not great, just a few of the killings, or I say ""wounds"" are okay, but you do not see much and there are no body part props in the movie to make the injuries more convincing.

Pavlov's Behavior Modification Clinic is she cured of her cravings for fur? even the fur of the puppy skin she had so much wanted.

And now she needs an extra puppy (hence 102 Dalmatians) to complete this nefarious project. <br /> <br /> Ioan Gruffudd is immediately more appealing than the hero of the film who runs the Second Chance School.

He prances and poses in the most sophisticated fur clothes you've ever seen? and do it well. His ""Wicked Witch of the West"" tribute is hilarious. <br /> <br /> Tim McInnerny is outstanding Cruella is not that evil stooge? he was also ""Alonzo"", ""Cruella's Butler"", in ""101 Dalmatians"" and you can also recognize him from all ""Black Adder"" Brit-Coms. He plays his usual awkward, good-natured, somewhat stupid character with great effect. <br /> <br /> Oscars for costuming are generally given for the entirety of costuming in a movie. This is unfortunate, because the clothes of Glenn Close is amazing? it is incredibly detailed (note her handcuffs when she is released from the Behavior Modification Clinic) and deserves such exaggerated character. Her clothes alone deserve at least one Oscar nomination. <br /> <br /> Animation has a special place in my heart? but comparing this movie to the original animated movie is like comparing apples to orangutans: it's not possible.

During his getaway, things go wrong, and soon get worse when he runs into the real hitman, Lyle.","""Red Rock West"" was by far one of the best thrillers of the 90s with a great script (by John and Rick Dahl), with the most of the film could sit on the edge through and through. It was brilliantly staged by John Dahl and featured a wonderful cast featuring Nicolas Cage, Dennis Hopper, Lara Flynn Boyle and, most notably, J. T. Walsh (in a memorable performance), making it a captivating and compelling thriller not to be missed. The film never had much publicity when it came out (in fact, I first caught it on TV) and is therefore one of those special little gems to visit, but this unique film is slowly gaining cult status. <Br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage is Michael Williams who is bankrupt and unemployed while in the small town of Red Rock. Failing a contract killer named Lyle from Dallas, he is shocked to be offered $ 10,000 for killing wife of barkeeper Wayne Brown (the award-winning J. T. Walsh). He plays with the plan and decides that he should warn Brown's wife Suzanne (Lara Flynn Boyle), but then the action thickens and there are so many twists, turns and surprises - and doubled business - that Cage from one crisis to the next is thrown and finds himself in a terrible situation, from which he can not tear himself out! Then, just to complicate matters further, the real Lyle turns up to execute the hitman (played by everyone's favorite, Dennis Hopper). When Hopper discovers what happened, he goes to Cage, but no one could predict the surprising events that follow. <br /> <br /> Some favorite parts of the movie: <br /> <br /> Nicolas Cage (to Lara Flynn Boyle): ""I hate to see an innocent woman get hurt, but it's a lot Money."" <br /> <br /> J. T. Walsh (to Cage): ""Michael Williams Well, Michael, you'll spend some time with us until we get to the bottom of it."" <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): ""You are not a murderer?"". Cage: ""That's right, no, but the guy I expected to have just ridden into town to get you out of here."" <br /> <br /> Boyle (to Cage): ""OK, the way you are. I'll explain that I'm disguising a paid murderer and taking $ 10,000 from my husband?"" <br /> <br /> An extraordinarily entertaining little thriller (only 98 minutes) with a story that never fades and looks powerful. Each film with J. T. Walsh is O.K. in my book and ""Red Rock West"" was one of his best. How sad it was that this exceptional actor's career was tragically shortened in 1998 by a heart attack. The most productive time for ""Film Noir"" was undoubtedly the 1940s, but ""Red Rock West"" is a good modern example of the genre and has gone straight to my ""Top Ten"" list of all favorite movies. I'm looking forward to more from director John Dahl. 10/10. Clive Roberts. <br /> <br />"

However, there is a problem every time the old man leads the police to the place where the murder occurs, that no body can be found. Soft For Digging has a small dialogue that reflects the majority of the film's scenes, an old man living alone in a house. During the movie, I realized that I was scared twice when the murdered child suddenly appeared in front of the old man. The rest of the film I have to admit has not bothered me; I found the tempo of the movie a little too slow. The limited dialogue was not a problem. However, the development of the story and its conclusions after watching the film took too long. I could have gotten more sense of the relationship, ghostly encounters with the child and the old man. Alone in the woods at night, insecure in your own mind, can lead to sinister situations, children are always scary like ghosts, see Dark Water."

It's very similar to the first Gozilla movie and, like this movie, has scenes with American actors inserted for no real reason. An interesting thing about the scenes inserted is that there is a tension between the Cold War and America portrayed between America and Russia. As in Godzilla, Gamera is awakened by an atomic explosion and rampages all over the world, paying close attention to Tokyo, as no big monster movie is complete unless Tokyo bites him. All in all, that's a good movie. Some of the scenes with Gamera, especially the scenes in Toly, are quite spectacular and have special effects that were pretty decent at the time. If you like Japanese giant monster movies, you'll really get a kick. I give it a 4 out of 10 points. If this were the unedited Japanese version I saw, it would probably have got a 5."

Scorsese approaches the films in terms of how they affected him as a director foremost and as a storyteller/film fan second. Segments include ""The Director as Smuggler,"" ""The Director as Iconoclast"", and so on. The Journey begins with silent masters like D.W. Griffith and ends in 1969 - when Scorsese began to make films; as he says in closing, ""I wouldn't feel right commenting on myself or my contemporaries.""","I never thought that I would almost cry if I cut a minute out of a 1920's black-and-white movie without a cut-out.

I mean dialogue scenes that are so brilliantly designed that I actually flinched and gasped for what I saw. It was like watching a rhino and a lion in a cage and watching each other gnaw each other to death. I am again very impressed by the screenwriters; whoever they are has made the impossible possible: mixed oil and water. <br /> <br /> I really enjoyed Juliette Lewis's performance. It is so rare that this talented young actress is performing nowadays, when she does, it is such a pleasure. Some of her moments in this movie brought tears to my eyes. I mean, that.

Why should Henry, though admittedly a sleeping bag, destroy the business to which he dedicates his life by robbing and perhaps murdering his customers? Why does the seemingly reasonable Tommy believe that Henry could be a murderer (almost entirely based on a dream), and even if that were credible, why not go to the police? And why did not Gale sound the alarm when she got home, especially after telling Howie she was off? Of course, all these events are necessary for the plot to unfold (and I use the term very, very loosely). And it could be forgivable if it led to the slightest comedy. But everything from Howie's description of his date rape, to the false identification of the medical examiner with Gale, to the last ""joke"" about Gale and Howie, who is still dead, is tastier and more pathetic than anything. <br /> <br /> I ticked the box and pointed out that my comments contained ""spoilers"", but there's nothing I or anyone else could do to spoil this thing that already stinks to the sky ,"

When she starts snooping around on the case of a murderer of teenage girls, it gets her in hot water with her mentor Detective Jerry Gunn. But it also starts a team up with police cadet Tony Campbell. The two work together to find the murderer. But the closer Mary gets to solving the murder, the more danger she puts herself in of being the next victim.","That's a nice piece of work. Very sexy and rousing enough to keep my interest. The main drawback is that it looks like it was made for TV: full screen, and although there were several sex scenes, there was absolutely no nudity (but boy it was close!). Strange too, since Netflix shows that it was rated R. Nonetheless, very exciting, and I wish Alicia Silverstone had made more films like that. <br /> <br /> A Netflix reviewer said that it was part of a series, but I could not figure out which series it was.

As group of strangers awaken with no memory to find they have been involuntarily placed in a maze containing deadly traps, a young man whose job is to watch over the Cube endeavors to rescue a woman trapped within.","I did not really like the first ""Cube"" movie. It was a good idea, but the annoying acting and the characters always kept me from liking it too much. I did not really feel the need to see its sequel, but when I heard that they were making a third film that would rather be a pre-history of the original. I was intrigued, thinking that maybe they would fix some of the original's problems and give us a memorable cast of characters. Well, I thought wrong. <br /> <br /> ""Cube Zero"" starts well enough by introducing us to the two characters who are responsible for observing and preserving the endless maze of traps that plague people in the cube. The filmmakers manage to give the establishment of the everyday life of the two men a mysterious feeling. This raises several questions, the reason why people are sent there and the true nature of those who lead the entire operation. All of these are completely up to the viewer. Acting was a bit weak, but overall, the first half of the film moved relatively well. <br /> <br /> As the story progresses, one of the two ""watchers"" begins to doubt seriously what he is doing. And later decides to help a group of people in the trap. Everything quickly dissolves into boring cheese. <br /> <br /> Sent by the people who run the Cube program, we are introduced to the character ""Jax"". Together with his two subordinates play a major reason why this movie has failed. At the beginning of ""Jax"" he looks and speaks more like a third-rate villain straight out of a James Bond movie complete with the ever-popular ""Glass Eye"" that alone ruins any atmosphere created by the relatively nice tempo of the first half. What's more, it feels more like a comedy rather than a serious movie. With some unbelievably cheesy lines, the scriptwriter might get bored and he did not care. The action itself continues to deteriorate when the former ""observer"" hits the group in the dice. The entire interaction is painful to watch, as well as everything else that follows. <br /> <br /> Once again, it's a waste of time for all those looking for a good horror movie."

Let me express that again, huh? Actually the word ""huh?"" you would think pretty much. Nothing makes sense, nor does it try. I just do not know if it's complicated cryptic or just a nested confusion, but there's no denying how laconically uneventful, funny, and wordy it feels.

Raúl Artigot draws only a few unusual images and scary passages, but for the most part he appears sporadically non-existent and unfocused as his writing. Ramon Semperes impressive cinematography characterizes the graceful, rich scenery, while we enjoy the picturesque views and pass the time leisurely. However, there are certain areas where it is too dark to see what is going on. Fernando García Morcillo's creepy, bombastic and overblown score combines with a compulsively dense atmosphere. The leads are capable, but there is also a robust group (the Pick Víctor Israel) of secondary benefits. <br /> <br /> Slowly with little interest, but this dreamy setup (that seems to go on and on) manages to watch you through to the end."

While it's not for everyone, it's a really brilliant, grim, funny, even more deeply disturbing story of love, sex, personal freedom and revenge, a serious morality even more relevant at a time when Congress wants to ban gay marriage by destroying our constitution. History, however, is not about being gay - it's about love and sex that does not conform to social norms and therefore needs to be eradicated through violence and hatred. On the surface, it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig, but like any big fable, it's not really about animals, it's about something bigger - suffocating conformity in America. <br /> <br /> The stage version gained international recognition in its original production, toured the US and Europe, and influenced almost every other drama that followed. Fortunately, we kept the show as well as originally planned, with the original cast and original director Tom O'Horgan (who also staged HAIR and Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway). <br /> <br /> This is not a mainstream, easy-to-take studio drama - this is an aggressive, disturbing, calm, deeply emotional, wildly imaginative piece of storytelling that you'll never forget.

9,tt0389326,1,"A semiserious, often rollicking, multigenerational insider's look at the origins of surfing, the colorful and subversive birth of surf culture, and the mythology and lure of the big wave. This passionate and fluid film is without question the first authentic history of surfing from its humble Hawaiian beginnings to the big business it became to the still-rebellious universe it inhabits today. Riding Giants is a study in individuality and freedom, the pursuit and techniques of pure kinetic pleasure, and the risk taking and attitudes that characterize its leading figures. For some viewers, this is perhaps more than they ever wanted to know. But Peralta's detailed knowledge of the surfing lifestyle, its icons and locations, its boom and exploitation by the media, and the fascination it has held for young men for more than five decades is unparalleled and fuels this expedition for the expert and initiate alike. Closely chronicling the sometimes-life-and-death drama that big-wave riding ...","Impressive! Stacy Peralta has been following Dogtown and Z-Boys with an equally impressive documentary about the history of big-wave surf culture in America. Along with insider footage and interviews from surfing legends, we are immersed in the daring and free-spirited life of the early pioneers whose passion for sports has spawned an industry that touches the lives of millions today. <br /> <br /> It gets to know these symbols and their stories that give the film its warmth. You can feel the respect that Peralta feels for this group as we hear reports from Greg Noll walking by a group of awesome surf surfers on the beach to challenge the 50-foot waves off Hawaii's north coast. Or Jeff Clark, who spent fifteen years surfing the outrageously dangerous Maverick off the coast of California, before he was discovered and became a surf destination in California. And the story of Laird Hamilton, the surf icon of today. Greg Greg Noll is reverently called Hamilton as the best surfer ever sent will cool my spine. <br /> <br /> (Apart from that, Noll, Clark, and others were at Sundance screenings.) Noll described himself humbly as an old, Over the Mountain surfer .He was deeply touched by the spectator's reception of him and the movie and Clark were personally as personable as in the movie. <br /> <br /> Riding Giants pays tribute to these exceptional athletes while giving us a glimpse into the scale and scary power of the waves they are trying to conquer greedy vertical drops needed to get into them, and the almost unfathomable combination of adrenaline and fear surfers experience every time they tackle a monster wave. <br /> <br /> All that, and the movie has more. For those of us who did not live in California in the 1960s, we get a glimpse into the impact of surfing on American pop culture (and, to my surprise, the impact of the film Gidget on the Surfing!) Peralta also interweaves some technical aspects of the sport and the history of innovation in equipment. I'm not a surfer, but like the rest of the Sundance audience, I was absolutely mesmerized by this movie. Peralta sets his claim as the Big Kahuna of American documentary films."

But definitely not worth it for a neutral audience. The combat sequences are a total comedy. The dance moves in the song sequences are pathetic. The music is average. This movie was the biggest flop for the actor. Despite the hype about the movie, the movie failed miserably. Do not even think about watching this movement, even if you want to kill time.

It is THE COMPANY. And it's THE DEVIL ADVOCATE. And there are NO new elements here. Except for the all-encompassing Bill Gates allegory. Conspiracies are always good things for filmmaking, but why must it be so extreme? Kesselraum is a good movie because it seems - at least for a while - realistic.

It should more correctly be called ""Earth, 2009"". Secondly, allow me to respond to the complaints of some reviewers who have seen the 2006 television series ""Planet Earth"". <br /> <br /> I have not seen this TV series, but here learned that this movie is full length version of this 2006 television series. I judge each film, on its own merit, not by its source. I judge the results for myself and the results of ""Earth, 2009"" are indeed outstanding. I reject this trivial complaint of some reviewers: that it is simply an enhanced version of the TV series ""Planet Earth"" from 2006. So what? It is not really important. <br /> <br /> As a film fan and one who has seen dozens of nature documentaries in my life, I was amazed and very impressed with ""Earth, 2009"". This is the debut feature of Disney's new Disney Disney section, following in the footsteps of Walt Disney's seminal and Oscar-winning nature documentary films of the 1950s and 1960s. <br /> <br /> Cinematography, film editing, music score, sound and narration are all excellent. There have been several other nature documentaries that have also been awarded in these categories. What truly distinguishes ""Earth, 2009"" is its scope. It literally covers the entire planet and covers all seven continents. <br /> <br /> After my first look, it was obvious that this documentary required a tremendous amount of effort and time and talent. <br /> <br /> Three production companies were needed for this great documentary. <br /> <br /> ""Earth, 2009"" convincingly recounts the stories of four species on their long hikes spanning over a year The seasons start in January and end in December, from the North Pole to the South Pole. <br /> <br /> Two special new high-tech cameras were used for this film: One camera has a 360-degree computer-controlled motorized rotating lens and the other is an HD camera with an amazing 1,000 frames per second. This film technique gave some scenes of ""Earth, 2009"" drama and beauty, especially the cheetah hunt and big white sharks that jumped out of the water to catch sea lions, and an aerial shot over the edge of the highest waterfall in the world. There are many breathtaking shots in this documentary. <br /> <br /> Via cinematography, music score and narrative there is drama, sadness, humor and great beauty in this documentary. With a great musical score performed by the world-famous Berlin Philharmonic, excellent creative and technical cinematography, and James Earl Jones narrative, I consider ""Earth, 2009"" to be the largest documentary documentary on nature films of all time. <br /> <br /> Five years of hard work, patience, talent and dedication have paid off very well here. This movie should be seen in all schools in the world. Among other things, I say an Oscar for the best documentary. Really, a stunning, amazing, exhilarating and great documentary. <br /> <br /> Highly recommended"

Having gone insane, he enacts cruel dental torture on his patients.","Not many films have really taken advantage of the fear of going to the dentist. Those in this profession have really intimidating-looking tools. Show screenwriters Dennis Paoli, Stuart Gordon, and Charles Finch that they have received a maximum shock-in-the-seat-shock-value from their premise. <br /> <br /> Corbin Bernsen, in a nuanced presentation, is Alan Feinstone, dedicated dentist whose train jumps off the rails early. As an unbalanced obsessive-compulsive disorder, he begins to think of ideas of decay, even imagining them where there are none, and equates decay with the corruption of society in general. After seeing his unfaithful wife Brooke (Linda Hoffman) carry on with her pool boy, he decides to punish her. At the same time he is under pressure from a smarmy I.R.S. Agent (Earl Boen, known as Dr. Silberman of the ""Terminator"" franchise) to do a favor that the agent is silent about Feinstone's financial affairs. Feinstone begins to perceive everyone around him as being forfeit in one way or another, and he goes on a series of murders as police detective Gibbs (the ever-welcome Ken Foree) picks up his trail. <br /> <br /> Director Brian Yuzna has great fun with the script. It allows some really nasty and remarkably entertaining gothic scenes that do just as well to create sympathy for the victims that thrill the audience. The script gives the Feinstone character some fine dialogues and is altogether pretty crafty and amusing, with big cans of jet-black humor (like Feinstone ordering a victim to ""get his tongue out of the way!""). Brooke and I.R.S. Agent figure in particularly effective torture scenes. The makeup effects are pretty good for the most part. And the film does a good job of maintaining its forward momentum as Feinstone, with his relentless pursuit of perfection, moves from a respected pro to a killer in record time. <br /> <br /> Foree, always cool and funny, is pretty much wasted in a standard detective role, but it's fun to watch Boen play his slimball part. Hoffman and Christa Sauls offer very attractive eye candy. And a pre-fame Mark Ruffalo can be seen in a minor supporting role. But that's all very much Bernsen's show as he sinks his teeth (excuse me for that phrase) into his plum-bearing role with full conviction. <br /> <br /> ""The Dentist"" is one of the most original and interesting horror movies of the 1990s. <br /> <br /> 8/10"

It was quite amusing, but at the same time annoying to find it so biblically inaccurate. The film follows what is known as ""the Bible code"" instead of following the biblical scriptures. This movie is extremely poorly made; from his writing to his directing to his hilarious horrible acting. It's depressing that people really get involved in this movie. It seemed more like a late-night movie that someone would watch on the US channel or a direct home video instead of a theatrical release movie. <br /> <br /> I recommend you not to watch this movie, even if your life depended on it."

The only two identifiable names are Shirley Jones and Rachel Ward, who make the only proper appearances (Jones can not make it through the entire series - Happy Woman). By the way, Ward has become very old since her ""Thorn Birds"" days. <br /> <br /> The only common thread in the plot - who murdered the heroine's father, who was wrongly convicted of murdering Dad - is released after six years in jail - stretched out so long and so hastily locked up that it does not matter to you who it is. There is a lot of ""steamy"" sex, multiple murders and any kind of rude behavior - of which hardly anything is interesting or credible.

Well, in that case, you just have to stay a long way from ""Want to know a secret,"" since it's just the tenth pointless post-""scream"" slander that has absolutely no redeemable value. The plot is extremely ridiculous; the characters are unbearably stupid, the gore factor is negligible and the whole thing is just boring! As you can already deduce from the title, this film is mainly inspired by ""I still remember what you did last summer,"" as events take place in a similar environment and the murderer's motivations are equally stupid. Why someone wants to steal ideas from the trash like ""IKWYDLS"" is a mystery to me anyway. At the very least, this film could fall back on the precious shelf of Jennifer Love Hewitt, while the girls in this junk, besides being brainless, are also terribly unattractive. One year after her friend's unresolved murder, Beth Morgan, her new adulterous lover, and four other foolish college students go to Florida to spend her Spring Break vacation in a chic beach house. The killer has not made a move all year, but now he follows the gang to Florida and starts slaughtering them while leaving the titular message as a kind of business card. You really do not have to be a horror expert to quickly figure out which face hides behind the unspeakably ridiculous mask, and the authors' attempts to get you on the wrong track are downright embarrassing. Since the plot is so thin, most of the film is purely irrelevant, including the subplots relating to the incompetent Florida police force and the ""mysterious"" FBI inspector, who seems to have a personal touch. The murder happens inexplicably outside the screen (do not you hate it when that happens?), There's not even a free T & A to enjoy it, and you'd better not bring me into the quality of the dialogues.

It's a delightful movie with a feel-good factor it achieves without crossing the line into slippery sentimentality. Of course sweet - without added sugar. <br /> <br /> One small point: It seems to me that the slight objections about Ustinov's character Pendelton, who is able to intervene and defeat system security, ignore the fact that Pendelton is clearly one of Genie / Savant in this kind of thing. Yes, the film was pretty computer illiterate, but it showed Pendelton ""studying computers"" in his apartment, and I believe the implication was that his gifts allowed him to devour the whole subject virtually overnight. <br /> <br /> There were a few strange moments in which, in some scenes, Gnatpole tried to test Pendelton's knowledge and call his bluff. I am not sure if we should think that Pendelton craftily got out of these situations, or if he actually had enough knowledge to pass the tests - it was a bit unclear. <br /> <br /> Certainly I needed to know enough to set up the dummy accounts. Presumably, Wallach and Ustinov have relied on their own rather foggy notion of how computers worked then, and to understand exactly what they are aiming at, it is necessary to know exactly what their concept was. They knew that something about ""procedures"" was important; They thought that the ""intelligent light"" could actually control safety rather than just indicate its condition; They thought that the properties of the (stupid) user terminal would greatly affect what could be done on the mainframe itself. Although I do not see myself apart from things like the graphics. <br /> <br /> Mostly, I think they are trying to avoid the subject of actual computer operations as much as possible, and they did that pretty well. I allow them to get some artistic license, I do not think their efforts had any bugs worth mentioning. <br /> <br /> CD"

The Americans totally hated it, because the US cut was so bad, though you could see the underlying goodwill in it. <br /> <br /> In terms of the US theatrical release (along with the newly released Blu-ray Disc version), it's faster and firmer than HK cut, the background music has been replaced by the dark, grim HK Music changed to hip-hop music; and many cruel scenes were cut out. However, the synchronization was a remarkable work as they tried to capture the voice and tone of the original actor. But the problem is Hak Hap (Black Mask), the film was designed to be dark, grim, superstitious and totally cruel. Unfortunately, the US release overflowed the cream they wanted, which in turn completely changed the undertone of the film (HK release was rated 18+) to be even funnier and more amateurish. <br /> <br /> Now let's talk about the original HK release. This movie is like a hidden gem, a prototype for the whole ""matrix"" of tides and ages. The fight scenes are totally awesome, even the camera work was a little ""old-school"" among HK movies. However, the style of the film was a unique blend of kung fu and pop culture. With all the leather, black costumes and decorations, this movie features a Batman-style superhero in a black mask against an ordinary gang of multinational supersoldiers, led by a punk heavy metal rock star boss. Yes, it sounds like the idea of ​​a disabled child, but it works. It's so impressive that the whole movie triggers nightmares in which foreigners wage a bloodbath in leather coats. In 2002, they made a sequel that had a PG-13 rating, but without Jet Li and Liu Qing Yun. And you know how bad that was because Li and Liu were the main characters of the movie and had strong personalities and an interesting friendship. And, did I happen to mention Francois Yip? Her roundhouse kick was totally cool, even cooler than the villain boss, because she did not use a stuntman for all the fights. Did I mention that she also smoked hot? Anyway, there are a lot of things to like about the movie. <br /> <br /> However, the movie also had a lot of problems. First of all, it's a mediocre script with the best potential, which means this production team deserves a better script writer. There are many highlights throughout the 100 minutes, but they often felt far-fetched and did not make perfect sense to the audience (the US version was even worse because all character development was dropped). Anyway, you can not ask too much for a comic-inspired action movie. In addition, this film is completely unsuitable for children. I will not recommend it to you if you are less than 20 years old. It's full of disturbing content like blood, blood, sado-maso costumes, extreme brutal violence and so on. Along with the style of the film, it can be described as a wet dream for heavy metal rock fans and action fans. (The US cut was milder, but if you want to see it, watch the HK release for what it is.) 7/10. Status: inspirational, hidden, underrated, adult."

It was one of many movies I saw with my parents, but that was the only one we left. Since then, I had seen Interiors only recently, and I could have lived the rest of my life without it. What a swanky, cumbersome and painfully boring piece from the 70s wine and cheese tripe. Woody Allen is one of my favorite directors, but Interiors is by far the worst part of his career. In the distinctive style of Ingmar Berman, Allen gives us a dark, angular, subdued insight into the life of a family caused by the psychological damage caused by divorce, alienation, career, love, non-love, bad breath, or whatever , The film deliberately has no comical relief, no music and is bathed in shady pathos. This style of film can best be defined as an expressionistic expression in nature, using an improvised method of dialogue to spread a ""deeper depth of meaning and truth"". But Woody Allen is not Ingmar Bergman. The movie is painfully slow and boring. But beyond that, I simply had no connection or sympathy for any of the characters. Instead, I felt only contempt for this parade of shuffling, wailing, nicotine-smeared martyrs who were forever searching for identity. In the midst of a cosmopolitan abundance and baked Brie intelligence, the story emerges like a fart in the room. Everyone talks about cigarettes in concerned platitudes and heightened language. Everyone is ""lost"" and ""struggling"", desperate to find direction or understanding or whatever, and it just keeps going on and on to the point where you just want to beat everyone. It's never about dissolution, it's just endless, introspective chatter. It is nothing more than a psychological drama that goes beyond the connectivity of the public. Woody Allen chose to immerse characters in themselves so that we feel excluded. And that's why I found this film painfully complacent and spiritually draining. I see what he was up to, but his insistence on spreading his message through Prozac prose and distorted film techniques throws them beyond the point of relevance. I highly recommend them if you feel a bit too happy and need something to remind you of death. Otherwise we pretend that this movie never happened."

In a particularly bloody scene, we find the so-called actor Earl Boen, who has completely destroyed his teeth with drills and whatever, which I feel is the absolute worst thing to do if you're a killer dentist.

You have it in Japan in the same place, in the same house. In fact, the Japanese director tried to make the same film as the original, the only difference being the casting of American actors. This became an advantage when the item ""strangers in a foreign land"" was added to the general horror. Not only were they haunted by an absolutely terrifying and ruthless spirit, but they were also stuck in a completely foreign land and had difficulty integrating into society. It just added the general anxiety that was built into the movie, and I thought it was an excellent note. <br /> <br /> Buffy is really doing a very good job. She looks vulnerable and can convey her fear well. There are no clever remarks that are so common in American horror movies, or liners that distract from the general darkness and horror of the character's situation. In fact, it was just as good as the ring, which I really enjoyed. I hope that the future of American horror begins more closely with the Japanese New Wave of Horror, which began with the incredible success of Ringu. We finally get movies that can actually be categorized as ""horror"" !! 8.10"

This is a 'runaway production' shot in England for political reasons and not for the usual USA tax-break reasons.

But some of the scenes take far too long (especially the wedding), and I found the exaggerated drama and unrealistic dialogue more for the stage than for the screen. <br /> <br /> The dialogue was particularly disturbing, and it seemed to get worse as the movie progressed. Most of the characters were either Italian or Italian immigrants living in New York in the twenties and thirties, but their dialogue sounded like they were practicing lines for a Shakespearean piece while mixing cement and laying bricks. I laughed towards the end, not because the filmmakers wanted it. I think the stilted poetry could be defended by saying that the characters spoke Italian, and the dialogue is a literal translation of how they would really talk. But it did not work for me at all. <br /> <br /> Another type of dialogue made me laugh for a different reason: the son of the main character, born and raised in New York in the 1920s, suddenly begins to laugh with a British accent. I just suspect that had something to do with the film being shot in England. <br /> <br /> I give this movie an ""A"" for effort and purpose, but a considerably lower grade for the performance."

After falling in love with the railroad magnate's daughter, he finds that he can't remain neutral and must make some difficult choices.","Zentropa is the most original movie I've seen in years. If you like unique thrillers influenced by Film Noir, then this is just the cure for all the Hollywood summer blockbusters that are clogging the movie theaters these days. Trier's follow-ups like Breaking the Waves have gained more recognition, but that's really his best work. It is striking without being distracting and offers the perfect combination of excitement and dark humor. It is a pity that he has decided that handheld cameras are the wave of the future. It is difficult to say who has distracted him from the style he exhibits here, but it is everyone's loss that he instead went in his hard theoretical dogma direction."

The day trip turns into a road trip while dad and son explore their past, their relationship, and why Sam's wife might have left him. The road trip includes fishing, drinking, playing pool, sleeping under the stars, and frank discussion. Anger simmers close at hand, as do love and hope. Where Sam's wife is - and why she left - leads to the movie's resolution.","""The Thing About My Folks"" came as a surprise. We had no idea what to expect. The film directed by Raymond DeFelitta, based on a screen play by his star Paul Reiser, turned out to be a pleasant time in the cinema. Although the film is predictable and we know what it will become, this is a journey of discovery where Ben meets his father. Maybe for the first time in his life Ben sees his father for what he really is, not the one mythical figure he has in his mind. <br /> <br /> The film seems to be a vehicle for star Peter Falk, and he runs away with the movie as expected. Mr. Falk, one of the loveliest actors to work in films during this time and years, is an actor of such stature to be reckoned with. As Sam Kleinman, the distant father of Ben, he is a man who is clearly misunderstood, not only by Ben, but by the whole family and his wife of forty-seven. <br /> <br /> When Muriel, the matriarch of the Kleinman clan, runs away, everyone panics because this woman, who was the strong figure of the family, is vital to keeping everyone together. Without knowing where she went, Sam shows up in Ben's house, confused because he feels abandoned, suddenly by the woman he has married and faithful for all those years. <br /> <br /> Ben, the youngest son, takes his father on a trip to look for a house he wants to buy so he can bring his own family from Manhattan to the country. The journey gives Ben the opportunity to connect with his father in a way he never knew, because the old man always showed his younger son a distant figure. Along the way, father and son realize how much they love each other and how the old man was misunderstood by his children. The love of Sams for Muriel spans the many years they know each other; they seem to be inseparable. <br /> <br /> Peter Falk is great in the movie. He is an excellent Sam Kleinman, the man who suddenly realizes that his life will change to the worst. Mr. Falk shines as the older man and there is never a wrong move in his interpretation of the man whose whole world is crumbling under him. <br /> <br /> Since we are not a Paul Reiser fan, we have to confess that as Ben Kleinman, he is right. Ben and his dad discover how much they have in common and their love for Muriel, the mother who sacrificed her life to keep the family together. Olympia Dukakis can only be seen at the end of the film. She makes a good contribution as a fleeing mother. Elizabeth Perkins plays Rachel on a grand scale. <br /> <br /> The film has a beautiful look thanks to the camera work of Dan Gillham and the excellent music of Steven Argila. Ultimately, the film shows a great team effort between its director, Mr. DeFelitta and Paul Reiser, who wrote it for the screen. <br /> <br /> Although this movie is clearly intended for an older audience, everyone should enjoy it."

Well, this high-tech computer room is furnished with something that looks like remnants from a 50s electronics lab. And the pancake make-up on the bodies woke me up. Not pancake makeup in the traditional sense, but what looks like dried pancake dough is on the skin. This is to support the notion that the bodies are calcified - although how the virus would perform this transmutation is an exercise left to the student (viewer). <br /> <br /> Oh, the virus. I'd like to tell you that this is not the absolute worst condition for a science fiction, horror movie I know, but I can not. A computer virus transmitted through a television screen (or computer screen) that becomes a deadly biological pathogen? Give me a break. Warp drives like ""Star Trek"" are one thing, but photons become viruses? This is so silly that the desired ""shock factor"" is simply not feasible. The strip could have used one of those horrible dream sequences where the dead come to life or a cat jumps out of the closet, or something, because the viral dingamajig does not. <br /> <br /> It is believed that Robert Wagner has the same excuse for playing in the discomfort Lord Oliver has given for some of his later, trashy settings.

3,tt0354690,0,Based on a comic book series. A woman burned at the stake in 15th century Sweden actually is Satan (Lucifer)'s daughter - and plots revenge against him.,"First and foremost, I want to tell you that I trust in comics, anime, animations, and stuff like that. It's true that everyone has their own preferences, but you can trust me in this movie. I will be objective. To start the story - it's OK. Follow the history of comics as far as I know them. But the animation ... Well, it's not really bad, but it's definitely cheap and mediocre. It would be much better if they did not try to imitate the anime style and stick to the original comic-style drawings. If we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects of fire and lightning, you could say that the movie was shot about 10 years ago and more. Looks a bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985. For example, look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 - 4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell of a lot better! In addition, the voice talents make nothing remarkable, the music is nothing special. All in all - there is a lack of atmosphere. I saw it, but I can not say that I really enjoyed it. It just does not catch you. There is a lot of blood and violence, but that does not impress me. Maybe it's shocking for someone who has never seen mature animation and sees animated blood for the first time (is anyone around?), But I do not think this is the audience for this movie. So they could add a little nudity and spice. The chicks around Lucifer were pretty tasty, and hell, we have Lady Death ourselves! There are some sexy looks, but that's not enough. Rather than Bill Brown's music, it would look better on a Hard Rock / Heavy Metal soundtrack. All in all - the movie is not so bad, but if you want something better, take the original Heavy Metal, Heavy Metal FAKK 2000, Ralph Bakshi's Fire and Ice or Wizards maybe.

8,tt0363940,1,"In April 2002, an Irish film crew is making a documentary about Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, when a coup from the opposition is made.","One of the best documentary films of recent years. Some points ... <br /> <br /> 1. Hugo Chavez was elected president of Venezuela in 1998 and his support came mainly from the poorer parts of Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 2. In 2002, Chavez was sold off in a coup d'état. At that time, Irish filmmakers Kim Bartley and Donnacha O'Briain were in Caracas shooting a documentary on Chavez for British television. Her film deconstructs the coup d'etat and its consequences and electrifies the history that takes place on-site and outside the presidential palace. <br /> <br /> 3. Chavez aimed to free Venezuela from the free market policies imposed by the US. Although Venezuela's oil was already owned by the state, it was led to private advantage by executives who wanted to replace Chavez. <br /> <br /> 4. Although Venezuela is the fourth largest oil supplier in the world, Venezuela remains flooded with poverty and its resources are literally sucked away by foreign multinational corporations. <br /> <br /> 5. The documentary begins with Chavez's first years as president before the coup. It focuses on its popularity among the poor and its various policies that were popular with the locals (education plans, distribution of oil revenues, democracy on the grassroots, etc.). <br /> <br /> 6. Chavez was a great advocate of education and printed thousands of copies of the Venezuelan constitution, encouraging children and adults to study and understand them. <br /> <br /> 7. When Chávez came to power, he immediately promised to redistribute the oil profit. This, understandably, made the oil companies nervous. <br /> <br /> 8. A media war broke out. The six private television stations immediately began to oppose the state TV station. They questioned Chavez's motives, mental health and sexual orientation. <br /> <br /> 9. Without media support, the coup would not have been successful. The film makes clear that the putschists rely heavily on the media to spread information, and that news can be easily made. <br /> <br /> 10. Under the guise of the ""restoration of democracy"", the opposition silenced the state television station, dissolved the National Electoral Council, the Supreme Court, the National Assembly and took control of the military. <br /> <br /> 11. Monetary interests, supported by the military elite (encouraged by the US and the CIA), organized a civic march in the presidential palace to bring about the coup. Snipers shot at Chávez supporters, but the private media stations worked the material, so it seemed as if the refire was targeting the opposition march, which had indeed been safely diverted. <br /> <br /> 12. The police shoot at Chavez supporters and ravage the streets. <br /> <br /> 13. Chavez, imprisoned, refused to step back. Of course, then the media / government lied and said he had resigned, but Chavez's Cabinet members told the truth to the international community, which eventually brought the cable TV news back to Venezuela. <br /> <br /> 14. People rose and pressed for the return of the elected president, which only a referendum could replace constitutionally. <br /> <br /> 8.9 / 10 - With just over an hour this doc is far too short. Nevertheless, it is a captivating piece of journalism and is about a form of ""media warfare"" that is rarely touched. Is a great counterpart to ""The Battle of Algiers"". <br /> <br /> Worth a visit."

1,tt0228891,0,"When five bodies turn up in the waters of Burman City, its illusion of safety is shattered, and Mayer Hackett will stop at nothing to see the peace returned.","*** Possible plot spoilers *** <br /> <br /> I admire Dennis Hopper. I wonder why in 2000 he adopted The Spreading Ground as a police detective. This movie is totally annoying and I'll tell you why. <br /> <br /> This is about a small town that is currently getting a contract for a sports arena. One difficulty: There is a killer at large and that is bad for the business. The mayor makes a deal with the Irish mob to find the killer and make sure he never gets to court. Det. Ed Delongpre has other plans. He wants this guy to get caught too, but he's up to the level and believes in the system. He wants to see that the system does its job. <br /> <br /> That could have been pretty good. It could have tied. It was terrible. First, they call this guy a serial killer. Err no. There are certain criteria and nothing fits here. The villain killed 5 children on the first day, and I think it was 2 on the second day. This entire film stretches like a 48-hour period .... Hardly a serial killer action. I do not care what twisted motives they give him in the end, serial killers do their act over a long period of time. Not only are you suddenly killing 7 children in two days. That's a spree. <br /> <br /> Ok, besides, the acting was horrible. The only name here was Hopper, and he's the only one who nearly got his own way. Unfortunately he is a type of guy for me and I think he does psycho-parts much, much better. That was just not a good vehicle for Hopper. It did not allow him to do what he does best, which is to act scary. It's not that he did bad, it's that I made him so much better. <br /> <br /> The Irish mob-type Johnny Gault (Tom McCamus - The Long-Day's Journey into the Night), who is responsible for her investigation, is just overly stiff. Contradiction? Not really. He tries to play the cold, hard guy, and he does that to the point that the character is only made of wood. Drilling to the max. He did not scare me. He never inspired any emotions except boredom. I can not tell you how many times I checked how long it was until the end of this movie. <br /> <br /> The other thing is that it had the feel of a TV movie. You know what I mean. The bad production values, the low budget, the reuse of scenes to save costs. Only eh. Yanno? But I feel like comparing them with them is an insult to them. <br /> <br /> Derek Vanlint was both director and cameraman on this project. He bit more than he could chew. I can not help but feel that Hopper must have taken this role as a personal favor to a friend. That's the only reasonable argument I can think of. That was Vanlint's first job as a director, third cameraman. I hope that was a learning experience for him. <br /> <br /> I will not ruin the end in case you decide to torment yourself with it, but I would say that everyone dropped the ball here. ..the hopper. In a scene that was emotionally heartbreaking for the detective, it was just ... well ... blah. I did not see any of the fear that would accompany this guy's entire gearshift. Very disappointing. <br /> <br /> These 100 grueling minutes and Rated R for violence and language. No child under the age of 13 will be interested in seeing this, so do not worry. It's not suitable for anyone anyway. heh. <br /> <br /> Skip this. You will thank me later."

After the experiment can't be reversed, it takes a toll on Caine's personality, causing him to hunt down and kill his colleagues","(some spoilers) - as if you did not know how it will end up <br /> <br /> My expectations for HOHLMANN were high. A very good commercial, a director like Paul Verhoeven and actors like Kevin Bacon and Elisabeth Shue, plus a very interesting topic - Invisibility. Every requirement for a great movie has been fulfilled. Unfortunately, these things were not important at all. The movie was very week, without tension and terribly predictable. <br /> <br /> It's about a group of scientists who have discovered invisibility. After the animal experiments, Kevin Bacon decides to test it on himself. As soon as he is invisible, he changes completely and realizes the advantages of not being seen. From this to murder there is a very thin line. <br /> <br /> Hollow Man is a bad movie. It suffers from the disease that many new films have: the special effects. From a challenging theme that could have led the producers to an exciting psycho thriller, Verhoeven ruins everything that focuses only on special effects without betraying the true value of the movie. I have to admit, the FX are awesome, probably the best I've seen since Matrix, but that's not enough to make a movie good. Actually, that's the problem with today's movies. Like Verhoeven, most directors only care about spectacular scenes - and nothing more. The exceptions are very few, and probably the Matrix is ​​the only movie that combines perfectly fabulous special effects and great action. <br /> <br /> After Starship Troopers, Verhoeven disappoints again. In place of a great movie, HM cr * p. There are only 2 reasons why you can watch this movie: 1. the special effects 2. the joke with Superman and Wonder Woman (I will not spoil that moment for you ...) <br /> <br /> Okay, so, what went wrong with the movie? Everything. Let's see what I can remember. <br /> <br /> --- It's not tense at all. It should have been, but it is not. <br /> <br /> --- It is too predictable. You know from the beginning who will die and who will live. <br /> <br /> --- Instead of focusing on the psychological part, Verhoeven only cares about the effects. <br /> <br /> - - a lot of clichés. <br /> <br /> --- Of course, the villain wakes up a few times before he dies. <br /> <br /> --- As in any horror of inferior quality, the first rule to let the characters separate as much as possible. Every time someone is alone in the lab, perfect sacrifice for Bacon. <br /> <br /> --- Some holes in the plot. Example: In the beginning, Bacon has to scan his finger to get to the lab. After being invisible, how can he do that? <br /> <br /> --- The end: absolutely terrible. <br /> <br /> --- After Shue hits Bacon in the head, Bacon falls to the floor. Then Shue and Brolin leave quietly and slowly, without looking back. Is that normal? Then Bacon gets up, attacks them, they ""kill"" him again. And then Shue screams ""I heard an explosion"" (happened a few minutes ago) and they suddenly run inside. Did not she hear this explosion some time ago? <br /> <br /> --- There's a scene where you see the microphones hanging over the actors. Come on, Mr. Verhoeven, I expected much more from you! <br /> <br /> So this is Hollow Man. What should be a great movie became a scam. <br /> <br /> Vote: 4 out of 10 (for the special effects)"

Ben Stiller had immediately come to mind in some pretty good black comedies, ""Flirting With Disaster"" and ""Duplex."" Be sure that ""Envy"" is not a black comedy.

Unfortunately, he can not sexually satisfy her and ignores her. Frustrated, she goes home and wants a divorce. Then, one day, she dives into a lake in the middle of the forest. Her horse gallops with her clothes ... and she runs after! She meets the young and very handsome Adam (Aribert Mog). They make love and she realizes that this is the man she wants. <br /> <br /> ENDING SPOILER !!!! Of course, since this was done in 1933, she must be punished for her sin, which leads to a tragic finale. End of the end spoiler !!!! <br /> <br /> These horrified people in 1933, but it's pretty tame by today's standards. Lamarr's nude bathing shows nothing and when she runs after the horse completely naked, it is either shown in extreme wide-angle shot or is covered by branches and the like. There are only a few shots of her breasts. Even though she has sex with Mog, nothing is shown except her face, but you see her reach an orgasm. This scene was considered extreme at the time and was completely cut out of the American release. Today they are back. This movie would now easily get along with a PG-13. <br /> <br /> Shock episodes aside, that's just OK. It is beautifully filmed and there is virtually no dialogue. Apart from the music score, this could be a quiet picture. Fortunately, all actors are good - Lamarr and Mog especially and they are so attractive that they just take their breath away and watch them. The sequence they love is one of the most beautiful shots I've ever seen in a movie. The scenes with the sexual symbolism (there are not a few of them) are unfortunately pretty obvious today. I actually started giggling during one! <br /> <br /> So, great direction, beautiful pictures, attractive actors, good acting everywhere - but I was not overpowered by it. I found the movie slow (beautiful pictures do not make a picture for me), a bit boring, obvious, static and had a negative ending. I can live with the end, but it does not excuse the other problems I had with it. Even the last sequence is really strange - and out of place. I admire this movie more than anything else. It was well done and I would recommend it with caution. Many people seem to love this movie, so I'm in the minority. Use your own judgment."

I was surprised that I was getting increasingly tired as the plot progressed and my headache caused by static electricity increased. I found White Noise beyond our best efforts to lift unbelief, absurd. Even after witnessing the shocking ordeal of Michael Keaton, I was completely untouched by his death. Until the credits, I diligently waited for something - anything - substance to connect with the story of the characters, but such relief never came. Sure, there were occasional cardiac arrest moments, but only because loud noises tend to do this to the drowsing viewer. <br /> <br /> While acting was lame, Michael Keaton may have played his most common role. The only redeeming quality White Noise has to offer is the stunning architecture in both Keaton dwellings. Overall, White Noise leaves the morbidly depressing notion that those who die are trapped in a world guarded by three vicious shadows. They try to get the living to follow the dead into their own graves."

From this slender trail, and that of a single stem of grass discovered in the car, they gradually trace back first the victim and then her killer, in a case that's all science and legwork, and no magic inspiration.","This police procedure is no worse than many others of his era and better than some. Obviously, it follows in the steps of ""Dragnet"" and ""Naked City"", but turns out to be a pleasurable programmer. Best of all, it's the unadorned look he brings to a world long gone ... New York's mid-late-40s / early-50s sublime. Here it is in all its glory, from the old-school tattoo parlors, to the cheap hotels, to the greasy spoons. These old police films are like travelogues in a bygone era and very bittersweet for anyone who does not like the hygienic, soulless cityscape of today. <br /> <br /> Also interesting is the emphasis on the scientific aspect of solving the crime ... in this case the murder of a tattooed woman found in a deserted car. Our main heroes, detectives Tobin and Corrigan, do the footwork, but without the tedious and laborious efforts of the ""lab boys"" they would not achieve anything. Although the technology is not in the same league, the police here use the stubborn persistence of a C.S.I.

I enjoyed John Miles when the lanky ex-marine policeman Tobin became ... he had a cheerful, serene approach to the role that was a welcome relief to the usual stone histrionics of most film cops of that time. Patricia Barry is sweet and adorable like his naughty girlfriend who helps to solve the crime. Walter Kinsella is stuffy and droll like the older detective Corrigan. I liked the chemistry of the two and did something different from the robotic ""dragnet"" approach. <br /> <br /> The mystery itself is not too deep, and the latest hunt and shootout will certainly not be among the classics of the thriller, but during the short run, ""The Tattooed Stranger"" has more than held my interest."

Apparently Necromancy, which is the original, is better, but I doubt it. <br /> <br /> Most scenes of witchcraft still contain most of the necromancy scenes and these are still bad. In many ways, I think the added nudity has added some entertainment value to witchcraft! But do not be fooled - there are only 3 scenes of nudity and there is plenty of people standing around. No Diabolique rumpy pumpy involved! <br /> <br /> This film is so inherently horrible, it's hard to know what to criticize first. The dialogue is awful and straight from the Troma cabinet. At least Troma is obvious. This is a personified bored boredom. The play is variable with Pamela Franklin (Flora, the obsessed kid in The Innocents, would you believe it!) The worst thing with her shrill screaming voice. Welles just seems to wait for his paycheck. The other female lead has a scary face, so I do not know why Pamela thought she could trust her in the movie! And the doctor is pretty bad too. He also looks like Gene Wilder. <br /> <br /> It is inappropriately filmed with scenes that change without reason and the cutting is choppy. That's because witchcraft is a copy-and-paste job, not a subtle one. Only the lighting is fine. The sound is also terrible and it's hard to hear with the appalling new soundtrack that never closes. The ""ghost"" mother is also nonsense, but the actress is so weirdly bad at acting that she causes at least unintentional laughter. <br /> <br /> Really this movie (at least the witchcraft) is only for the careless. It can not have a lot of decent fans as it is quite unplayable and I actually found it dull boring! <br /> <br /> Best of all, when the credits were rolled - enough, that's just how better to say this poor excuse for a movie like the plague!"

There are no characters that seem sympathetic or interesting (in particular, the main character has nothing BETTER in it), and the assembled actors barely do anything to outgrow F-class material.

She is much better in this film than in her previous films as Warner Brothers in the late 1930s (with the exception of Broadway Musketeers in 1938, she is really good at it) when they tried to make her a Shirley Temple / Sybil Jason hybrid , Overall, this movie could be better, but in the end, Judy gave it all."

When he finds that his equally destitute sweetheart Katie has been reduced to prostitution, he succumbs to temptation and betrays his former comrade Frankie to the British authorities for a 20 pound reward. In the course of one gloomy, foggy night, guilt and retribution inexorably close in...","Like many people here, I started to try my patience with this movie. In the end, I actually shed some tears. <br /> <br /> It seems to be in the nature of most old films, 7/8-length to pull and then to catch fire in the end. Older movie-goers learned to walk patiently through the slow parts, reassured in the knowledge that the big win is on their way. But that is not exactly true. You see, for earlier listeners, the ""slow parts"" were the bulk of the story. They observed and found there anecdotal and thematic interest. The modern public, Post Spielberg, is constantly waiting to reach a small climax every two minutes when watching older films. It is the inflation problem of modern films. Well, that will not happen. It is not necessary to apologize for these films; It's easy to adjust your expectations and your personal rhythm when you see them. At this point, the difference between Avatar and The Informer is the difference between Euripides and a traveling production of Rent. Think about it for a minute or two. Not concentrating on the obvious, but Euripides deserves to be heard. <br /> <br /> The ""exciting part"", for most modern audiences, starts with the IRA tribal scene and escalates to the last few minutes that will be yours when you're on board or up to that time tear out the heart. It is not some high-pitch universal abstract plea for forgiveness; It is a request from a fool, and those who are sorry for the great Lummox, for a little mercy. It's so personal and this embarrassingly naked appeal. After being angry at Gypo, irritated by him and thinking that this is the dumbest character of all time, one finally finds himself convinced by the scene of Gypo's former girlfriend, who asks another woman to make her husband join him help. <br /> <br /> The film can be sentimental, but the sentimentality is not cheap, as some have charged here. There is a question of life and death happening here, and as long as you take a life's proposal seriously to a client, it's the sentimentality that is squeezed out of the most serious stuff. <br /> <br /> 8 out of 10. And the mistake of not being 10 out of 10 is your own and to some extent yours if you read this. We have all been asking for more, more and more, faster, ever faster, until in 1935 - just yesterday, really - we can not put ourselves in the position so easily."
2,tt0459387,0,"An introverted, socially awkward, middle-class youth, Robert Carmichael, is a talented cello player but is bored by his existence in the coastal town of Newhaven. He becomes associated with several other unsavory teenagers and is soon tempted into the use of hard drugs like cocaine and ecstasy. Robert initially does not take part in the rape of a teenage girl in a squalid flat with the gang, but later joins in another violent attack on a middle-aged couple, with the woman involved being viciously raped.","With a title ""borrowed"" by Werner Herzog and liberal contributions by Kubrick, Haneke and Noe, it is painfully obvious that Thomas Clay considers himself a cut that goes beyond the usual garbage of our British cinema. ""Robert Carmichael"" (in short :) presents itself as a realistic study of youthful alienation and at the same time apparent criticism of the Iraq war. The problem with realism is that the characters are so obviously unrealistic and atypical - unlike the stinking notions of ""extreme"" filmmakers, most teenagers are not drug-addicted rapists. As a criticism of the Iraq war, a film about youth violence (by a gifted classical musician - the subtext society has harmed this sensitive individual) is so childish that he can hardly think. There are signs of technical skill, but some reviewers have overdone it. Like Kubrick and Noe, he shows that the desire to shock combined with supposedly serious intent could be the worst cinematic trick of the last film. People liked ""Clockwork Orange"" and ""Irreversible"" because they liked the rapes and the violence, but most of all, they liked being culturally superior because they loved things that they hated the most. So much Kubrick and not enough Haneke (a serious and moral filmmaker) calls this one of the darkest movies in years. (I'm not against film violence, but to be serious it's a tough trick - people in the cinemas cheered Alex in ""Clockwork Orange"" and showed how Kubrick's supposed intention was missed by miles.) Gratuitous violence is much easier reach and less insulting than the claims of many art film directors.)"

The Peter Jackson-led live action trilogy ""The Lord of the Rings"" will undoubtedly be much better than the ""Prequel"" trilogy (Episode 1-3) by George Lucas will ever be the true fantasy film series of the 21st century! > <br /> I remember seeing the animated version as a child and not fully understanding the depth of the film at the time. Now that I've read the books, I understand what the story is all about. However, some of the characters are pretty silly (Samwise Gangee is particularly annoying, much like Jar Jar Binks in Star Wars Episode One, (AWFUL!)), But I have to say that he follows the book fairly closely, and it goes into part from Book Two, The Two Towers. The good things are that the plot is a bit interesting and some of the animations are quite remarkable for the time being. The bad part is that it ends halfway between the Two Towers, without Frodo trying to destroy the one ring, and the animation looks pretty outdated compared to today's standards. <br /> <br /> Overall, not as bad as many say. BUT, the live action version of 2001 is the new trademark of The Lord of the Rings! At least Ralph Bakshi took the script seriously! Peter Jackson said that the animated version inspired him to read the books, which in turn made him create one of the greatest fantasy series of all time, so at least we can thank Ralph Bakshi for that! I will take the animated version of Lord of the Rings on the live version of Harry Potter! <br /> <br /> A 7 on a scale of 1-10, far less violent than the live version of 2001, but NEVER close so good!

Wuthering Heights could be transformed into a plausible modern story - nice and soapy, melodramatic and fascinating. But this movie decided to discard the talents of people involved in a simple version so diluted from the source material that it is amazing that they had the courage to even call it Wuthering Heights. It ignores the fact that it is a story of people who are essentially dissimilar, mostly unsympathetic, and often cruel to each other. It changes the nature of certain characters - Isabelle, for example, in the novel, had no sneaky bones in her body - they have taken off their blind idealism and turned them into a scheming whore. Heathcliff is a terrible person who mentally tortures most people on his way, but in this version, Catherine leaves her daughter in his care. The dialogue is banal, and one wonders how the actors managed to deliver with straight faces. Instead of depth or actual emotions, we know that they mean something when they scream someone in the face. I read critiques of the early 90s version of ""Emily Bronte's Wuthering Heights,"" in which Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche were portrayed as turning a very dark Gothic story into a frothy bodice ripper. A little valid comments, but the MTV version goes one step further and uses the basic story structure to deliver hacker beach-bums that romp around to really bad music."

It's fun and makes you smile and that's what the show does. The dancers and questions, the round fashion they are presented, only add to the attractiveness of the shows. And although a lot of money is at stake, it's fun. The pressure (stress) that exists in most game shows does NOT exist here. Several people who have posted news have complained about how much time is lost with the dancers and questions are being selected, etc., as Millionaire has no similar time wasters. All I can say is that most of you missed the whole concept. The idea here is to have fun and enjoy yourself. There is something for everybody.

I'm still here, but when we both came out, we were amazed that it only took two hours - it seemed like a much longer evening! I suppose it should be exalted or intriguing for Yanks because it involves rich people living on the beach - well, next to the beach, in a house with a large porch and a lawn, but no apparent mower. If that impresses you, it could be a short movie. <br /> <br /> There's a Monty Python movie about a knight who just will not die. It ends up fidgeting (why do yanks add a third syllable to that word, which I'm wondering) Torso on the road, still yelling threats to his archenemy. This movie is also about a kind of living dead. Vanessa Redgrave (inappropriate name for the grave robber shown here) goes on and on while she has inappropriate guilt feelings. She is not worried about being a pale, breathless Bimbo, but imagines a killer. <br /> <br /> Obviously, it's a girl's movie that's supposed to be a Mr. Darcy / Heathcliff character. I am not a Whofter, so I can not claim to be a good judge of such things, but the boring sissy rolled for this role seems to have only the title of a servant in his favor. He is a bloodless cipher. <br /> <br /> As you may notice, the main characters are not much cop, but the smaller ones manage, surprisingly, to be much worse off. There's a guy whose only job is to respond to the news that his girlfriend is preggers. Of course, but it's not the role of Hamlet - why is it so bad?

You would have thought that they did it right. Sadly, the accident is committed by a car that can not be there. When the accident is discovered, the actors wander around screaming for a character they can not know is nearby (but we make the audience). If they have no idea the person is only a few miles from the location, why are they wandering aimlessly and calling him? I suppose the director's apology is that it should be a half forgotten dream sequence ... <br /> <br /> Another scene item that caught my attention was a saucepan with copper bottom.

2,tt0272620,0,Biography of the lead singer of Queen.,"This is a review of ""Freddy Mercury The Untold Story,"" theatrical release, Chicago Int. Film Festival, 2007 One of the most magical, unimaginative and boring biographical documentaries I have ever seen. If the movie I saw in a movie was originally released on television, I would ask its producers and distributors not to deceive a paying audience with the false promise of cinematic worthy documentary. The sentimental piano solos, which were presented to the interviewees in front of the flower arrangements in the hotel rooms and the pompous, pseudo-literary narrative, even fulfilled the feeling of a sleepapedic bed infomercial even as a TV documentary. The only redeeming aspects of this ""Unknown Story of Freddy Mercury"" - or, um, it was ""The Unpublished Story of Princess Diana"" are the original concert, video and television recordings - unabridged Freddy Mercury and Queen. Testimonial interviews with irrelevant eyewitnesses with insights such as, ""He was a free spirit"" (really .. I thought Freddy Mercury was a company man ...) belittle those Freddy testimonials, from Brian May or Montserrat Caballe, to the reissue and Loving light in Mercury's complex life and character. And ... what's up with the Harry Potter-like boarding schools? How did the interview with the first girl swarm (""... who now works in a travel agency"") and members of Freddy's first school band contribute to what I really want to know about Mercury? Vital milestones of his personal life, his sexuality, his artistic style and his growth, Queen, the band remain unexplored.

First of all, I'd like to say at first glance that I seriously doubt that Paramount will ever get the money back from this film. It could become a cult hit, but only because it is so remarkable for what it has not achieved. I can now see the studio pitch. ""Combining German expressionism of the 1920s and a global adventure of the 1940s with a modern action movie and dominating every scene with computer animation! Wow, that will not be a success!"" Skycaptain bludgeons the audience with his sheer excesses. There are too many false explosions, too many unconvincing dogfight scenes, and too few real moments when the characters are anything but painfully two-dimensional. After all, why shock and awe with a floating airship when you can have three or five or a hundred ?! In addition, a groundbreaking film that blends computer-generated imagery and human actors seamlessly in a stylized and intriguing environment will be a flop, not least because it does not meet CGI's most important requirement in film. Quite simply, the graphics are amazingly bad. From the movement of the cars to the physics of the aircraft in the air battles everything seems to be just a bit offside. I'm not fussy in any way. A child might notice that a car does not glide across the street like a maglev train (unless it's a Mercedes S500). And for those of you who raise your voice in protest and yell, ""This is a stylized film, it should not be like reality,"" let me just say that. Lord of the Rings has set the standard for integrating real actors with CGI, Starship Troopers has set the standard for ironic sci-fi movies, the Rocketeer has done a solid job of putting the decade of the 1920s back into the Hollywood film industry. Portfolio and Tim Burton's Batman created a unique image of New York City / Gotham that has not been repeated yet. Sky Captain is so close to all these movies that it's hard to mention them in the same sentence. Plus, acting is so poor, it makes me sick positively. So, there you have it.

The cameraman was probably a camcorder glued to a skateboard and pushed forward until it hit a wall. In the scenes where the camera is supposed to stay calm, it keeps moving and does not allow us to stop anywhere. If she moves in action, the camera will stop for some reason. <br /> <br /> The Producing Who on Earth is stupid enough to put money in this bomb? I feel sorry for the fool ... sometimes. Sometimes I'm glad that he or she has learned such a lesson in never putting money in the bin, worse than dog waste in a bag. <br /> <br /> Writing / Storyboarding - Trying to analyze the story is more painful then jamming an ice ax under a big toe and kicking a football as hard as possible, but I'll try anyway. <br /> <br /> Edward Carnby escapes as a child from an orphanage where 20 children where one can go under scientific experiments. He escapes and hides in a power outlet where he gets electrocuted (that's the point where it got so bad I started laughing out loud).

Later, he is attacked by a crazy monster and discovers secrets that nobody else knows. <br /> <br /> Yes, the plot is bad, really bad. The cinematic beings expect us to read about 10 minutes, which feels like 100, of random text about an untrue civilization called Abskani. The movie has no turn after turn, more than the audience can handle, more than the audience wishes to cope with, more than the audience could ever care.

The first shot is a camera shot by a robot about to hit a bomb, and of course it's shaky. But then the rest of the movie stays in ridiculousness in Shakycam mode, even in quiet conversations. Do the tenements have no tripods and steadicams? The fact that it was shot to 16mm does not help, as the entire film is grainy and wobbly. <br /> <br /> Despite all of Bigelow's efforts in precision vehicles and equipment, there are enough glaring mistakes and disagreements that undermine the film's credibility. <br /> <br /> - A car would not go up in flames after a single shot and would be suffocated by a small hand extinguisher. <br /> <br /> - A single Humvee would not drive around Baghdad in 2004, but would be assisted by other vehicles in the event of a collapse or attack. - It would be extremely unlikely to hit an insurgent insurgent at a great distance, where the bullet clearly takes a second to reach the target. <br /> <br /> - I think bombs were dumped on or near a base to certain disposal areas, not anywhere in the desert. <br /> <br /> - The attack on the oil tanker is said to have taken place in the Green Zone, a highly secure area with very few internal attacks. The zone consists mainly of offices and palaces with few residences, but is presented as a dangerous labyrinth of dark streets and lurking insurgents. Oddly enough, James never gets into trouble over the ridiculous tactics of ordering his two companions to take each other a lane to prepare for the attempted abduction. <br /> <br /> - Speaking of which, the 3-man team is always portrayed cleaning buildings, chasing insurgents etc. on their own, even if there are dozens of soldiers right there. <br /> <br /> - How many hours does the team have to stare at a dead insurgent hanging a window to find he's not pretending? <br /> <br /> There were no founding shots to show the viewers what the size and layout of the base was or where Baghdad was related. I had no idea who the EOD team was reporting, and no other characters had been drafted. These are things that the characters would know, so we should too. <br /> <br /> Many of the ""surprises"" and scenes are perfectly predictable. Yes, it is obvious that the psychiatrist colonel will be in trouble with the Iraqis he is trying to persuade that the choice of grain at home will be overwhelming, and that a driver whom you have kidnapped will not wait for you when you leave the vehicle br /> <br /> Finally, there was an almost complete lack of character development. Renner's character has a problematic relationship from the start, is ruthless and addicted to adrenaline. He's the same at the end of the movie. What's the point? <br /> <br /> If this is indeed the best of Iraqi war movies, it is a sad bunch. Based on the half-hour that I saw, I would instead recommend Generation Kill on HBO."

Bill Paxton hired a first-class talent to make a good thriller with some interesting twists. The story is original and well written. Powers Booth and Paxton both perform well. The story is narrated in an interesting way, with the flashbacks 20 years ago, then in the present, alternately back and forth. This kind of storytelling makes for a good thriller that can not get boring. Bill Paxton, please make more horror movies, you have the talent for it!"

At least that's what he thinks. But Ben hadn't planned on falling in love with one of these people and she's the one who will end up transforming him.","Seven Pounds stars Will Smith as Ben Thomas, an IRS debt collection agent who has an ulterior motive to meet those who are back on their tax payments. Thomas has caused the deaths of seven people talking on the phone while driving, and the film follows his attempt to atone for his obvious, unpardonable crime. <br /> <br /> The story is as subtle as a brick a green house window. What you see is exactly what happens - even the end of the Titanic was more surprising compared to Seven Pounds. There is absolutely no twist, there is never any confusion or doubt about what happens. <br /> <br /> I usually only like Will Smith when he's in Bad Boys mode. The guy is at his best when he carries a gun, drives a Ford GT and says ""Aw Hell Close"", when he tries to behave seriously, he just appears as a pathetic attempt to get an Oscar who is so desperate for , That's probably the main reason why I did not look forward to the movie, even though it's very understated here. There are moments of comedy, but they are subtle, in fact it was the most submissive performance of Will Smith I've ever seen, and for that very reason he was fantastic and ironic should be nominated for a grand prize. <br /> <br /> The supporting cast were all great too - Rosario Dawson looked pretty closely at deaths from throughout the movie and Woody Harrelson and Barry Pepper were fine, with all the other little players. <br /> <br /> Overall, it's a whiny - but it does not throw away all the usual clichés and sentimental violins to give you no choice but to cry. There were a few times that even my hard heart almost broke. It will be hard for you to find none of the situations that are not related to your own life, which makes it all the more real. <br /> <br /> I would give it 8/10. The Will Smith Show moves into drama without the despair of The Pursuit of Happiness, and makes it all the better."

In hopes to save the unconscious crewman, the amnesiac is interrogated back into remembering. Those in charge thereby learn of the terrible dangers awaiting anyone venturing into the spooky, ruddy stillness of the very alien Martian ecosystem.","The Angry Red Planet <br /> <br /> Like ""The Man From Planet X,"" this is a bizarre sci-fi story from a time when fantasy and sci-fi are still condemned were close. That is, we have some highly ridiculous special effects and wild pseudo-science masquerading as science fiction. And yes, it's another ""classic"" in a high-quality broadcast with a sharp image and sharp sound - from Midnite Movies. <br /> <br /> So, the main reason to watch this movie? Oh, it's definitely the whole time our Space Crew is on Mars. (What, you thought, ""Angry Red Planet"" was referring to Neptune?) Before that is a pretty bad space crew boarding a spaceship where they smoke and making sexist chauvinist banter against the ""weak female"" member of the crew. By today's standards, it would be a bit offensive if it were not so funny. But Mars is the real reason why we observe this thing. The film is generally black and white, but Mars, well Mars is screaming blood red. It's filmed in that bizarre red plastic sheen that gives the angry red planet a pretty interesting look of overexposed redness. It's really a sight, as the (ha ha) aliens spectators are witnesses. The best is the Ratbatspidercrab. Do you think that's a joke? That's what they call it in the movie! It's a gigantic chimera (little doll) of a thing that combines the characteristics of rats, bats, spiders and crabs. It borders on all puppets and terrifies the horror of our ""heroic crew"". There are other strange and ill-conceived aliens that you can see, but you take the cake.

It's worse for Billy as Woody, who is not worried about the move, is at that stage in his life where everything is simple and easy. Billy's first day in the fifth grade at his new school does not go well when he gets into an altercation with the class bullies, led by Joe Guire. The altercation involves worms and Billy stating that he eats worms all the time, which leads to all the bullies calling him ""Wormboy"".

I knew the movie would be out soon, so we went to the library to get the book and they gave us preview maps for the next day! We hurried home and spent the afternoon reading the book so we could compare it. Was not necessary. The only thing common between the book and the movie is the fact that there is a bet, and a lot of worms. Oh yes, I almost forgot that the boy who cooks the most worms presents his masterpieces with a French accent. How the children know each other, the number of children involved, how the bet was made, the number of worms to eat, the time frame in which to eat the worms, how they are cooked, the progress of the friendships, climax Scenes, etc., NOTHING is the same. But somehow it did not ruin the movie for me. The characters are fun and the movie did not disappoint. A word of caution for the parents, there was a moment when the adults in the room were collectively holding their breath, and that was when Billy's little brother called his penis a ""fat cock."" The embarrassing part came when my daughter continued to ask those around us, ""Does anyone know what a fat cock is?"" lol. That and an occasional ""shut up"" is as disgusting as this movie. My daughter thought she could get Worms 3 and 4 (and kept the empty Nacho tank for all cases), but she was fine with Worm 6.

This movie started in an interesting way, but quickly the scale went from confusing to boring. Most of the confusing parts were created at the beginning, where the editing scenes are so numerous that you can hardly say what's going on in the first twenty minutes. The dull comes later, with a lukewarm romance between the two living humans (both pushes). The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is indeed the liveliest person in the movie who is sad. If the rest of the cast had grown to its caliber, the movie might have been better. <br /> <br /> Maybe. Because the storyline becomes interesting for a while as it looks as if the mentally ill priestess is trying to raise the dead sixteen-year-old girl's mother from the dead, with the unfortunate side effect that all the other dead would come back human form and most likely start killing everyone. A kind of Japanese mystical night of the living dead. But that will not happen. Although this hairy unwashed priest with a tiny basket on his head tells uninteresting young people that this will happen when the priestess finishes her ritual, she does just that and the only dead person who manifests herself is her daughter. No mass rebellion of the dead, no wandering army of corpses, nothing. The priest only brings the ghost of the girl back to the Land of the Dead and takes with him the washed-out friend of a friend who had crushed her like peanut brittle (at that point I was tempted to cheer aloud, so.) Idiot went over to that DEAD girl to kiss and stroke, ohwww !!!). The Robitussen sucking, spineless best friend ends up with a long, introspective attitude as she leaves the village for the last time, and that's it. No real horror, no real horror, which tends to make the Japanese better than American filmmakers with their emphasis on exaggerated cheesy facial make-up, no screaming mimis. I was very disappointed."
10,tt0071507,1,"Italy 1600: A convent of nuns are invaded by the Tarantula Sect on their annual pilgrimage. The cultists defile the place of worship, orgying in the chapel and desecrating the altar. One nun decides she can't take the religious oppression any longer and flees the convent upset that all the leaders are male.","She was expecting another Nunsploation movie with a malicious Mother Superior, who abused and tortured her allegations. Flavia turned out to be MUCH more than I expected. <br /> <br /> It actually has a feminist history, though I do not think such a term existed in the era in which the film plays. It certainly was not practiced. Women (and the Jews and the poor) are very oppressed and imprisoned in the lower reaches of society. Throughout history, Sister Flavia (Florinda Bolkan) experiences the tyranny of her time until she just can not sit there any longer and actually does something about it, albeit with catastrophic consequences. <br /> <br /> The pre-credit sequence has Flavia as a young adolescent near a battlefield. She sees an injured ""evil"" Muslim soldier (one of the few still living) and tries to help him. Before she can, her hateful father beheaded the soldier and waved his head in his face (big family dynamics, huh?). Afterwards, her father forces her to join a monastery, where she sees more injustice. Although scenes include violence, rape, and nuns, I would view this as a historical drama rather than a nuns ploitation. <br /> <br /> In fact, many of the ingredients for a trashy piece of evaluation are there, but the acting, the camera work, the plot and the music are too good to keep it at this level. Most of the ""nuns"" movies I've seen usually have the following basic assumption: A good girl ends up in a convent where the matron is a huge bitch who likes to whip people and / or make their lives hell <br /> Flavia passively spends much of the first part of the film questioning all the atrocities that are taking place around her. Much of her passivity is forgotten when she meets the strong (but a bit crazy - she likes to pee outside like me, but it's a lot easier for boys) Sister Agatha. As a group of Muslims attack their abbey, Flavia and Agatha are not frightened like the other nuns. Their attackers actually function as their liberators (the cruelty and near slavery of the abbey). In fact, it is a Christian, not a Muslim intruder, impaling sister Agatha. <br /> <br /> It is Agatha's death that sends Flavia on her violent crusade against those who oppressed her ... Her father treats her like dirt. Your Muslim lover leaves you at a very inappropriate time. I do not want to tell too much of the rest of the story, but be prepared to be shocked, devastated and saddened by the end. This is a great movie, so do not let it deter you from its (undeserved) reputation as a trash epic. And how on earth could a film go wrong with Florinda Bolkan and Claudio Cassinelli? I am not familiar with the other works of María Casares, but Sister Agatha is a hellish figure. <br /> <br /> I've read a lot of great reviews about the release of Synapse (US), but I love my German X-Rated cult DVD copy. It's not anamorphic / 16: 9, but actually has a little more image information on all edges than the release of Synapse. <br /> <br /> And there are also many great, wise or funny dialogues (many by Sister Agatha) <br /> <br /> ""Why is God male? The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit? are all male! "" -Flavia <br /> <br /> ""These men are scared - look at them, sister - fear they will lose their power!"" -Sr. Agatha (regarding Christians who flee after the Muslims arrive) <br /> <br /> ""Woman, where are you going, the Muslims can not do anything the Christians have not done! Ha Ha Ha!"" -Sr. Agatha (to a group of fleeing Christian women) <br /> <br /> ""Lord, bless these Muslims - for frightening these pompous Christians."" -Flavia <br /> <br /> ""Does it take the mere sight of a Muslim to make you $ h! Your underwear?"" -Sr. Agatha <br /> <br /> Closing message: ""Flavia Gaetani, not yet a Muslim - no longer a Christian - was punished as an outlier The idea for the film came from events that culminated during the Musalman invasions in Italy still remembered today as THE MARTYDROM OF THE 800 AT OTRANTO """

Those who suffer from a serious lack of innocence will find a problem that connects with this masterpiece. De Sica spoke very directly. His Italianess does not have the kinky self-examination of modern Italian filmmakers, or the bitter self-parody of Pietro Germi, the sharp bittersweetness of Mario Monicelli, the solemnity of Visconti, or the cold observation of Antonioni. De Sica told us the stories like a father sitting on the edge of his cot before going to bed. There is no attempt to intellectualize. Miracolo A Milano and to a lesser extent Il Giudizio Universale are realistic fairy tales, or what we call magical realism today. The film is a jewel from start to finish and Toto is the kind of character you accept with an open heart, but of course that requires you to have a heart. Cinema in its purest form. Great."

Through the guidance of his doctor, he confronts his painful past and begins a quest to find the family he never knew.","A few years ago, the Navy kept the development of ""Men of Honor,"" a film based on the experiences of the Black Master's first fight to overcome virulent racism. Always eager to support films that show the best side of our Navy, the U.S.S. Nimitz and two helicopter attack ships, with supporting land installations, were provided to supplement this captivating story of a young sailor's fight with uncontrollable rage. Part of the film was aboard the U.S.S. Belleau wood. <br /> <br /> Antwone Fisher has written the script for Denzel Washington's directorial debut, playing as a Navy psychiatrist with Fisher, effectively and deeply played by Derek Luke. <br /> <br /> Fisher is an obviously light-hearted soldier assigned to the USS Belleau Wood (LHA-3), a front-line helicopter attack platform. Fisher can not avoid launching his own attacks from his peers with minimal provocation. As part of a possible pre-separation procedure, Fisher is assigned to the MD. He opens slowly to the black psychiatrist and reveals a terrible childhood of neglect and shattering brutality. <br /> <br /> The story evolves as Fisher cautiously, but increasingly familiarizes his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest, a registered sailor named Cheryl, played by a stunningly beautiful Joy Bryant. <br /> <br /> Fisher reluctantly reluctantly asks the doctor by asking long-simmering questions, but soon realizes he needs to seek the answers, even if they are painful to grow and move away from conflict-relevant destructive behavior. <br /> <br /> While all the main characters are black, this story transcends the breed and shows fearlessly the evil of exuberant religiosity and the associated hypocrisy in foster care. Viola Davis, a versatile actress featured in a series of recent films, is a picture of sullen immorality, but nothing compared to foster mom, Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), who would earn in short but burning scenes - if there was Oscar for brutal brutality. <br /> <br /> Films about patient-therapist interaction have a certain predictability (all these transference and countertransference things), but the seriousness of Fisher and his / her mentor is realistically tangible. It's a good story, well told. Period. <br /> <br /> While ""Antwone Fisher"" plays in the Navy, it is in no way a service story like ""Men of Honor,"" an excellent movie that deals with smashing racism against a real person , It's not a movie about black people either. It's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, announcing in adulthood that the victim is still ""upright."" The persecutors are shrinking in size and importance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the help of a caring physician. <br /> <br /> My only contention is that Washington is a Lieutenant Commander, but is addressed as a commander. With all the supporters of the Navy listed in the credits, somebody should have told Washington Director that his character, like all naval officers, is addressed under the rank of commander as ""mister."" No big criticism, right? :) <br /> <br /> I do not know why this movie plays in so few theaters. It deserves a wide distribution.

It's based on a novel called 'Not Too Deep' by Richard Sale, which may or may not have been interesting, it would require research to find out! The story in the film takes on many incidents and a lot of background obviously existed in the novel, but nowhere to be seen in the film, so that the film was either brutally cut or the script was confused from the beginning.There is not a millisecond in this film, which is realistic in terms of events or characters away is pure Hollywood fantasy in every way, two well-known actors, Paul Lukas and Peter Lorre, are so worn out and wasted that it made no sense to be in the film at all, they must have been thrown into the mix, in style and manner How to sprinkle a piece of omelet with chopped chives in the hope that the taste will be improved. ""The film is a cumbersome attempt to create a"" moral hte ""and is so cheesy that it is ridiculous. The story is about some serious criminals who are imprisoned in French Guiana and want to flee their French colonial prison through a jungle (very much Hollywood jungle with a rubber band). Of course, there must be a woman in the story, so Joan Crawford keeps it as an unfortunate tramp that, for some reason, becomes irresistible to Clark Gable, one of the escaped criminals. Crawford, who has escaped through the jungle, wears high-heeled shoes and keeps her makeup fresh. Gable flirts and twists and makes grotesque facial expressions, curls his eyebrows as he is used to, grins and looks suggestive on all of what his way of acting is. It's hard to treat such a character as a hardened criminal if he's always trying so hard to be Clark Gable that he certainly will not have time to be a thief. (Attention seekers are by definition too busy to steal and unfit for a task that requires people NOT to see them.) The whole escapade is so ridiculous that it can only be considered light entertainment. An attempt at religiosity and ""depth"" is made by injecting into the story a mysterious angel of mercy who voluntarily goes to jail pretending to be a prisoner. He helps with the escape and accompanies all criminals and ministers to their different deaths and helps them find ""peace"" in their last breaths. This character is played very well by Ian Hunter, who is convinced by a convincing atmosphere of secret knowledge, smiling enigmatically, making cryptic prophetic remarks and having a small spot on his face to give it a heavenly glow. The theme should be redemption. You could call it the Donald Duck version of Hollywood Goes Moral and Gets Heavy. For real depth, Hitchcock's 1953 ""I Confess"" shows how it really should be done. In contrast, this banal nonsense shows how empty the lockers of Meaning were in Tinsel Town, and that if they were looking for something that could mean anything, everything they could imagine was more tinsel."

DO NOT miss this or Goshas other classic, Goyokin! Hitokiri is not only one of Gosha's best films, it's one of the best ""Samurai / Chambara"" films ever and perhaps one of the best Japanese films ever to be exported. <br /> <br /> Be forewarned, all the complicated plot details in Hitokiri can be a little hard to follow for those unfamiliar with 19th century Japanese history. Nevertheless, the underlying human drama is obvious and open to all viewers. According to the Gosha standard, Hitokiri offers another variation on his traditional theme of ""loyalty to his master"" versus ""doing the right thing"". Anyway, Gosha is developing his favorite subject with such sophistication that it's really the movie to see (along with Goyokin of course). <br /> <br /> I suppose it breaks like this: If you want a simpler, more action-oriented story, you might want to see Goyokin. However, if you want a more elaborate, complex (though grim) drama, look at this. <br /> <br /> (OK, OK, basically the historical background is a huge power grave between many different Samurai clans who either work (1) to reform and keep the Tokugawa shogunate, and (2) Those who try to install Emperor Meiji as the supreme ruler of Japan. Of course, those clans who worked for Emperor Meiji were often less interested in ""reforming"" Japan than giving their own clan more power in the country. "" Ironically, the entire feudal system was formally abolished as one of the first Meiji government reforms, ironic phrases like this - Gosha's ironic - that makes the whole thing all the bittersweet. <br /> <br /> What distinguishes ""Hitokiri"" from Gosha's other films is Gosha's mature cinematographic sense, each recording is thoughtfully composed, and (like Kubrick's Barry Lyndon) every frame of the film could be a still composition n exist. Of course this is typical Gosha. Hitokiri stands out with breathtaking scenery, including (like Goyokin) many captivating seascapes. Just look at the opening sequence and you're excited! Make no mistakes, this is not an English testimony of time: Hitokiri is extremely violent (do not say that you have not been warned). <br /> <br /> What else does Hitokiri do except for a cool camera work? The performances seem to me to be a bit more subtle. Katsu Shintaro (of Zatoichi / Hanzo the Razor Glory) turns in a star performance as the conflicting protagonist / antihero, Okada Izo. Katsu manages to give humanity a character who seems to be more of a wild animal than a villain. Throughout the movie, you're never quite sure if you're engaged or outraged by Okada's character. At the same time, Katsu's portrayal of Okada's craving for respect and his later pathetic attempts at salvation seems so human that one can not help but feel empathy / compassion. After watching Nakadai Tatsuya play the tormented hero in ""Goyokin,"" it's great to see him playing such a ruthless villain in ""Hitokiri."" He is just perfect, there is nothing left to say! <br /> <br /> As a final comment, perhaps more interesting for buffs than for occasional fans, do not miss the last appearance of Mishima Yukio (yes, the closed gay guy). The right-wing ultranationalist novelist who stands in front of the jubilant crowd of Japanese military men he ""kidnapped"" in 1970 and shot a film about his life and work by Paul Schrader, who took his life from Seppuku, who actually does a pretty good job of honoring (for an assassin) Shinbei Tanaka."

When Angel- a seductive vixen in a red dress- appears from nowhere and smothers him with attention, he finds himself in a situation most guys wish for. Faced with temptation, Richard makes a seemingly innocent suggestion that sets in motion a series of events that ultimately unbalances his world. When the dust settles, we witness Richard's small but profound epiphany about the true nature of love.","Love Trap is an independent movie you must have seen. When I sat down to watch the movie, I came in with low expectations, but left with a blessing. The story is poetic, contentual and creative. The author pulls you further and further in each scene so that you can relate to the realistic characters that everyone can identify with. The movie allowed me to think about my life and my love. The film showed what love really is, action not emotion. I was also impressed with the quality of the film's cinematography and soundtrack. The entire presentation exceeded my expectations. I'll give the film two big thumbs up and recommend it to everyone of all ages and backgrounds."

Ben and a colleague of Karens (Annie McEnroe) join him. <br /> <br /> A horrible screenplay, bad direction, awkward editing and really horrendous drama by Brown and McEnroe single-handedly sink this one. The werewolf effects are usually kept in the dark - for a good reason! They are terrible when you see them. Below average special effects too - though I liked the cartoon flash coming from Danning's fingers. There is also a werewolf orgy that is especially stupid and Danning takes at least EIGHT TIMES during the credits! <br /> <br /> There are a few good things - I found the village in Transylvania amusing - it looks like it's from a 1930s Universal horror movie! There are interesting camera ticks between transitional scenes; Brown and McEnroe have good bodies and Lee and Danning are good at it - but they can not save it. Really - WHY did you do that? Where do you hard for money ??? This is one of the least rated movies by IMDb. That alone should tell you something. Supposedly Danning was horrified when she saw the movie - I understand why!

Being around Oscar brightens Felix up, but he quickly starts to irritate Oscar.","There is nothing wrong with ""The Odd Couple"", and it's no surprise that Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau are a hugely successful comedy team. But there is something so underdeveloped about Neil Simon's adaptation of his hit stage play that it seems more like a sketch in a sketch comedy show than a full-bodied movie. I did not see the piece, but I have to assume that the screen version is pretty faithful, as Simon wrote it, so the errors are not due to an adaptation from the stage to the screen. There are some interesting ideas in this story - two recently divorced men who immediately fall into traditional married roles when they become roommates because nobody knows anything else - that Simon never completely fills out.

Would not every comedy be better if Mr. Clooney plays a weird 5-minute cameo and 2. how do they make fake tattoos that look old and faded, and how easy to wash? The performers, all of them good actors, have done a great job, and one gets the impression that they had a good time working together, which in a movie like that This is pretty important. Needless to say that everything in this film is not planned and humorous, but I had to check the specifics and look at the original, so I think it's a success! Rent this for a good time, maybe a few friends and a pizza. You will have a good time. <br /> <br /> *** 7/10 *** <br /> <br /> The soundtrack is spectacular.

I wish he was in more movies showing his talent. Soul Survivors was a very, very bad movie. Very bad. <br /> <br /> I would say that I blame almost everything on the bad script. Affleck is a very talented actress, Wes Bentley had an outstanding performance in American Beauty, Melissa Sagemiller did well, and Eliza Dushku is currently the It Girl in Hollywood. I do not think any of the actors really got into the script, and I understand why. To say that this movie belongs to the horror genre is an exaggeration. It had the twists and turns you would expect, but they just did not go anywhere ... except for more confusion. I found the ending to be very anti-climatic because it just did not make sense or really answered any of the questions I had about the plot. <br /> <br /> I wish I could give this movie a good review, but I can not. Honestly, the only thing you'll find scary about this movie is that you paid for it."

Each transition begins with the last shot of the previous film and ends with the first shot of the following film, extending the enchantment and the emotion of the previous segment, preparing the audience for a surprise, and providing a cohesive atmosphere. There's a reappearing mysterious character who is a witness to the Parisian life.

Of course, some are better off than others and some go for comedy while others focus on dramatic emotions. Some well-known directors are involved, including: The Coen brothers, Wes Craven, Alfonso Cuarón, Alexander Payne, Gus Van Sant and Gurinda Chadha.

He goes to a female throat specialist, Pamela Taylor, whom he falls in love with.","A crossover attempt to appeal to those who do not appreciate the opera and exploit the fame of one of the greatest opera singers of all time fails very much. All that is desirable in this film is the opera, and it is best to find a recording of Pavarotti doing what he does best. The plot revolves around a romance with a doctor who heals his neck, which has suddenly become tedious. <br /> <br /> Just because it's been so long, it's largely forgotten. Like most opera stars, Pavarotti is a decent actor and has stage presence alongside his vocal talents, and nothing he does in this film negates that opinion. His fault lies in not refusing the horrible writing. Maybe because great operas can have stupid stories, he has tolerated them. <br /> <br /> Who knows, except those involved? Do we need to know? <br /> <br /> The plot is weak and hackneyed. This movie is like trudging through cold mud to make a few juicy treats (the opera music) hanging over the mud. We have other ways to appreciate the great Pavarotti, and he is not one of them. Just pick up one of his many excellent opera or vocal concert recordings and recognize the master tenor where he is best suited. <br /> <br /> It would be one of IMDb's 100 Worst movies if more people remember and voices would vote; it would fit neatly into a list that includes several efforts of singers, actors, models and athletes to exploit their popularity through film. Very often it goes wrong because of incompetent acting or a terrible writing. Pavarotti would have been a decent actor if he had not shown such a great voice. How effective he is as an actor (opera demands it), not even Jimmy Stewart could have saved that turkey of a screenplay. <br /> <br /> I give him a polite 3 out of 10 because someone might be a fan of Pavarotti's singing and the opera because of this movie."

I did not really understand the humor back then, but this movie can make me laugh. <br /> <br /> With all due respect to George Burns (RIP), Walter Matthau really deserves the Oscar for this film.

And it does just that. No more, no less. Director Christopher Smith portrays the drama as much as he can by introducing a series of characters who would actually have a reason to be in the subway after closure. He deliberately leaves the origins of the eponymous creep vague (unlawful experiments that take place in the '60s underground are hinted at) and this little secret works for the most part. Sadly, he undermines himself towards the end by actually holding back from a twist end where further genetic abnormalities would appear (they are also implied).

Their ordeal is captured on CCTV cameras and before long the family's heart-stopping trauma is not only a complex police investigation but a major national news story.,"A series of posters commented on the unsatisfactory conclusion. This is always a problem with long, complex dramas. The crime is essentially banal, so the repayment is always anti-climactic, while the detailed depiction distracts from the human drama. The author used a bunch of clever devices to get around this, but was not quite successful. Answers to exactly what happened and why, may have been delivered, but if so, they are well buried. The viewer inevitably feels cheated. <br /> <br /> But in a way, that's not important. The drama was never about the crime or even the investigation, it was about the impact of events on the lives of those involved; the family, the investigators, the witnesses, the press. And as such, it was gripping. The writing was a significant cut across the mill's run for home-time drama, and the performances equally well. In an ensemble piece, focusing on individuals is tricky, but Penelope Wilton deserves a special mention for an extraordinary tour de force as the mother-and-wife daughter, and Janet McTeer was in shape as a hardened old cop. > <br /> One of the most interesting aspects of the drama is the handling of the breed, as the elephant in the room, which no one is prepared to mention.

The requirement is similar to Cellular and Phone Booth, but Red Eye is better than these two films. Almost everything about Red Eye is above average, including excitement, acting and directing. Most of the movie is on a plane, but that does not slow the movie down. The movie is very fast and exciting, with no slow or boring passages. Wes Craven does a really good job behind the camera. Instead of focusing on the thrill, he focuses on the story and the characters. The film has its share of exciting moments, but that's not really what the movie is about. I also like how Wes Craven focuses on the other passengers and the little details that will matter later. Red Eye shows his storytelling skills. <br /> <br /> Red Eye also works well because of its young and talented cast. Rachel McAdams gives a very engaging performance and her character is hard to hate. You can even cheer for them at the end. Cillian Murphy gives a very scary and effective performance as a villain. The way he first behaves charmingly, but then becomes psychic, is particularly impressive. The supporting actors are also pretty good, including Brain Cox and Jayma Mays. <br /> <br /> The movie is also very stylish and it has this totally weird vibe to it. The setting works well, as there is an obvious fear of isolation and no escape. Overall, the sound of the film is always scary. The script is not as strong as anything else. There are a few unrealistic moments that can distract the viewer. Most of them did not bother me, but there were only a few who shook my head. The end is disappointing too. It's not a bad ending, just a very simple and different approach would have been better. Since the movie focuses on the characters, there are really no screaming moments, maybe just a few jumps. If you expect a horror movie, you will be disappointed. In the end, Red Eye is an engaging thriller and it's one of the best movies of the summer. Rating 8/10"

This film, accompanied by ""I'm Curious: Blue,"" is a masterpiece. <br /> <br /> The only thing that will disappoint you in this movie is if you do not like the process of the movie, not psychology or if you expect hardcore pornographic ramming. <br /> <br /> This is not a movie you want to watch to relax; It's a movie you want to see like any other masterpiece, with time, attention and care. <br /> <br /> ****** ABSTRACT, MAY CONTAIN A SPOILER OR TWO ******* The main thing about this movie is that it mixes the whole movie within a movie thing, but it does in a way that sometimes one forgets that the fictions are not real. <br /> <br /> The movie is like many movies in one: <br /> <br /> 1. A political documentary about the social system in Sweden at that time. Which in many ways are still relevant today. Interviews of a young woman named Lena. <br /> <br /> 2. A story about a filmmaker, Vilgot Sjoman, who makes a movie ... about a relationship with his star in the film and about how he should never deal with people with whom he should work. <br /> <br /> 3. The movie that Vilgot is doing. It's about a young woman named Lena (IE. # 2), who is young and very politically active, she's doing a documentary (IE. # 1). She has also grown up and in her sexuality and the freedom of it. <br /> <br /> The splendor and sheer brilliance of ""I'm Curious: Yellow / Blue"" is how these three elements are cut together. One moment you see an interview about politics, and the next you watch what the interviewer is doing behind the scenes, but that makes it so good that sometimes you forget that it's the narrative. <br /> <br /> Another thing is the dynamics between ""yellow"" and ""blue"", when you see one, you have to see the other. ""Blue"" is not a sequel. I'll try to explain it as well as I can, because no other movies have done it to my knowledge, although it's a great technique. <br /> <br /> Think of ""yellow"" as a living thing, actual events in 14 scenes. A complete story. <br /> <br /> Think of ""blue"" as all things that are between the 14 scenes in ""yellow"" that you have not seen, this is a complete story in itself. <br /> <br /> Essentially, these are parallel films ... the same story told in two different ways. <br /> <br /> Only when I saw the first 30 minutes of ""Blue"" did I understand ""Yellow"" <br /> <br /> I hope that was helpful for people who are discouraged by various influences, because this movie changed the way I watched movies. <br /> <br /> Thank you for your time."

It would be bad enough if the script required only a switch to white chicks. However, the Wayans brothers have to disguise themselves as two particular white women. As you have guessed by now, they fail completely. I've seen drag queens without make-up are more convincing women than these two with the best special effects and make-up people Hollywood can offer.

I read it in my ninth grade and it was great. We also decided that it would be good to watch the movie. The movie was so disappointing for me. The film cuts out some characters and misses many of the main points of the book. It jumps around a lot and does not explain anything in detail. If anyone had seen this film without first reading the book, they would be confused. The most disappointing thing about this film for me was the end. The end in the book was the most powerful and in the movie they changed it! It was meant to be pigs and men in an alliance and somehow ""melted together,"" but instead, the film made it look like the animals were rebelling against the pigs.

No, Madonna did not come for Voguing, but here she has it! Instead of inflicting violence on each other or in bitchy cat fights, one allowed oneself to compete in an environment in which one hardly touched one another (which would justify an automatic disqualification).

However, it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and hard movie. <br /> <br /> The story has been seen before, the dialogue is artificial and the acting is very bad, especially by the lead actress. The film attempts to paint a picture of hard-nosed, military-looking robbers without remorse, and a female investigator who has completely lost her with past problems, but at the same time acts rationally. It does not work very well. <br /> <br /> The bluish-styled photo style does not seem to be fresh anymore, and in this picture it did not even work well. Only a few scenes look really good. Also, the sound sounds pretty weird and it sounds like many of the dialogues are being recorded later. <br /> <br /> The main quality of this movie is Stefan Sauk, though he does not make a convincing portrait of a SWAT team leader, has some really funny lines.

I can really immerse myself in a good art house movie, even in surreal and twisted fiddles like El Topo, Naked Lunch and Survive Style 5+, because these films actually have something to discuss when the credits roll. <br /> <br /> The FFFC tries to be so profound and intellectual at all levels, essentially there is no substance in this film. This movie is done poorly, the visuals in this movie are not inspirational, the dialogue is worse, the musical numbers destroy this movie .. I chuckled for GUITAR BROTHERS, but that was immediately wiped out by something completely unnecessary and irrelevant. It's been trying to be deep and meaningful, I think, but it's just pretentious disoriented nonsense. Freshman film students without a camera could make something more interesting. <br /> <br /> Guitar Brothers and the stand-up routines between the skits get 1 point at a time, everything else is poorly timed, pseudo-creative, hard attempt As good as films by other REAL directors like Sogo Ishii, David Lynch and Jodoworsky. Give me a break. I am convinced that the people who rave about the FFFC do so because they have no idea what they have seen, because there were only mild factual statements here and there mixed with stupidity and mingled until you get on your own Shoes puke. <br /> <br /> This film was an extreme disappointment, it came from the height that was Survive Style 5+, a movie that actually has meaning, combined with excellent use of landscapes, cinematography, catchy dialogue, funny moments , good soundtrack, excellent performances. fantastic speed and flow. FFFC offers the exact opposite in every way, boring landscape (20 minutes staring at a bland beach at night? A completely white stage? Alien balls floating in the white room? A dirty school hallway and then ... school hallway?), Terrible Cinematography, forgetful dialogues, nothing funny or humorous except for the fact that you have wasted your life for two hours, soundtrack ?, amateur performances, inconsistent, incoherent, and often fluttering sluggish pacing, no flow. <br /> <br /> There are some who claim that this is what makes FFFC a great movie that is so unconventional at every turn that it is a pure genius. This is simply a way of caressing one's ego, because ""unpredictable"" could be a good quality for a movie if it were not coupled with ""boring,"" ""innane,"" and ""awful."" Personally, I talked to two people who confessed to me that FFFC was terrible when they left the theater, but overwhelming rave of arthouse elites let them see the movie again and then with a ... ""Hey, it was pretty good, I liked it.

I say that because it's a documentary about a funny guy who made strange pictures and surrounded himself with weird comrades, and as such there's really no other way to document the life and career of the man and his crew of outsiders , There are some insights into the genius and inability of Wood, and the portrayal of both qualities is a merit of the authenticity of the documentary.

Oh!!!! how excited me and my best friend were. We could not wait for the month or so until that happened. I saw this movie 17 times a year in the theater. I love, love, love it. Kris is so perfect for the movie. He is naughty and somehow trashy, but also shy and insecure with Babs and it's so adorable to see it again. When they sing in the studio evergreen and he plays along with his croaking voice so different from the perfect notes of hers, I always thought that was one of the best scenes in the movie. How he looks at her and he is so proud. I could watch this movie every day. We tried to dress like est-the-use, I even have the long sweater and cap that looked like the one she wore. That came on time on TV and I saw my daughters that they were teenagers and they loved it. Maybe it was just that at an age when everything was extreme, I was so convinced. The end still blew me away today."

Sarcasm is the lowest form of joke, there are few really funny smart gags that would really make you laugh. People seem to be convinced by the familiar names of comedians, rather than judging the quality of the gags that are not really good.

The vision of Paris is superb, both recognizable and visionary, with far-reaching prospects, grungy set-pieces and futuristic virtual reality. <br /> <br /> The plot is pretty simple, with few surprises, but that's not what I like the most about the movie. It's an optical treat. <br /> <br /> Done in 3D and rendered in black and white (no grays!) with just a short blot, it's less hard on the eyes than it sounds. There are many ""arty"" camera shots - close-ups and strange angles - but that only adds to the temperament of the movie. Overall, you get the impression of a graphic novel in footage form. <br /> <br /> I initially had the impression that the film was rotoscoped, so the animation level and the details were in the facial expressions of the figure. But unlike ""A Scanner Darkly"" - which suffers from (or is even amplified by) an inconsistent character definition (just watch how some of the hair changes shape!) - Renaissance is consistently consistent and precise. When the character is in close-up, additional details and textures can be seen, but if details are omitted in the middle or farther away, but not at the expense of the character definition. <br /> <br /> For me The only negative side of the movie is that a comment says it's a one off project. Such a shame, because I would like to see more of this futuristic film noir story and especially in this cutting-edge graphic style. <br /> <br /> Oh, and the English dub is great too. All in all a great movie and highly recommended."
8,tt0079095,1,"This movie follows the life of a young German woman, married to a soldier in the waning days of WWII. Fassbinder has tried to show the gritty life after the end of WWII and the turmoil of the people trapped in its wake.","*** SPOILER *** *** SPOILER *** This is undoubtedly the best movie Rainer Werner Fassbinder has ever made and even with the wonderful script, the movie is enhanced by a great performance by Hanna Schygulla. The film begins with Maria (Schygulla) and Hermann Braun (Klaus Lowitsch), who are getting married while the bombs are falling and Hermann is being handed over in the waning days of war. Now Maria and her mother and sister have to survive. Maria decides to get a job as a dancer / prostitute in a club that meets American GIs, and she meets a black soldier named Bill (Greg Eagles) and they start seeing each other regularly. Maria hears that her husband Hermann died in the war, so she gets very serious with Bill. But one day, when they come into contact with Bill, they see Hermann at the door. He did not die and when he enters the room, a melee ensues and Maria breaks a bottle over Bill's head and he dies. Hermann takes the blame and is sentenced to a long prison term. Maria tells him that she will achieve something and get him out. The war is over and Germany has to rebuild. One day, Maria meets Karl Oswald (Ivan Desny), a successful textile entrepreneur, and uses her charms to find work. Maria is determined to do well, climbs the career ladder and becomes Charlemagne's lover. She tells him that she will never marry him, but he is in love with her. Hermann comes out of prison, but goes to Canada to do whatever Mary has done since he was imprisoned. <br /> <br /> ***** SPOILER ALERT ***** <br /> <br /> One day Karl dies and leaves Maria pretty much everything in his will and Maria buys her own house. Then Hermann finally comes to his wife and both are ready to marry, although they have been married for some time. But Maria leaves the gas on the stove and the house explodes with both still in it. <br /> <br /> There are so many interesting things in this film that it is one of those films that can be studied and discussed to great lengths. As in all Fassbinder films, the use of color is used in a very interesting way. At the beginning of the film, the tones are brown and gray to depict the war-torn Germany, but when Maria begins to succeed, they switch to bright, rich colors like red and white. The reconstruction of Germany with all the building noise is used as the only backdrop and the film focuses on the heroic deeds of Maria. Fassbinder wanted the sounds of reconstruction to remind us of what was going on in Germany at the time. Hanna Schygulla has never been better and her performance is the key to the success of this film. With a smaller actress that would have been just another interesting movie, but Schygulla is so strong that her performance elevates this movie to an elite status. Schygulla shows Mary as very purposeful and smart, but at the same time she uses her beauty and femininity to get what she wants. She is neither embarrassed nor guilty about it, and Fassbinder wanted to show Maria as a woman who practically sells her soul to survive. Schygulla was not nominated for an Oscar, but she has shown a great performance that will stand the test of time. Fassbinder himself appears in the film as a peddler and his own mother Lilo Pempeit plays Ms. Ehmke. I have heard many things about the end of the movie and it has to do with whether Maria purposely started the gas. Later in the bathroom, her water runs over her wrist and she seems sad. This is just speculation and if you think I'm wrong, please email me. I think she was overly excited because Hermann was home and accidentally left (Remember, she put on a dress for no reason?). When the will is read to her then she learns that Hermann and Karl have become friendly without her knowledge, and I think she felt that everything she had done was in vain. That's the reason for the bathroom scene. So if the house accidentally explodes. But I think the reason for Fassbinder's end is to show that anyone who would sell his soul has no business. Fassbinder was fascinated by survivors, but he was also incredibly passionate. In his opinion, Mary can not have both. A fascinating movie."

She is a street smart girl, her part is very similar to the one she played in the Roaring Twenties opposite James Cagney. <br /> <br /> Speaking of The Roaring Twenties, Humphrey Bogart's character development is similar to Tone, although he was not the central character of the film. In fact, there are elements of They Gave Him A Gun that can be found in Taxi Driver and in Clint Eastwood's classic The Unforgiven. <br /> <br /> The fighting sequences of the First World War are very well staged by director Woody Van Dyke.

The house that dripped blood is a horror bus - an anthology that contains four eerie stories about the tenants of a devilish, hellish house in the British countryside. A common mistake in productions like this is to waste too much energy on the ongoing story that connects each story. Peter Duffel's film does not pay much attention to this. It's just about a Scotland Yard inspector coming to the house to investigate the last tenant's disappearance, and he learns about the bizarre events that took place there before. All four stories in this movie are of high quality and together they make a perfect healthy. High expectations are allowed for this movie since it was written entirely by Robert Bloch! Yes, the same Bloch who wrote the novel that resulted in the brilliant horror milestone `Psycho '? We also honor Peter Duffel's solid and very professional debut as a director. <br /> <br /> The four stories ?? Chapter, if you want ?? In the house that has dripped blood, there is a wide variety of topics, but they are (almost) equally chilled and uncanny. Number one is about a horror writer who comes into the house with his wife to find inspiration for his new book. That starts off really well, but after a short time his haunting is haunted by the rogue of his own imagination. The idea in this story is not exactly original, but it is very exciting and the climax is quite surprising. The second story stars horror legend Peter Cushing as a retired stockbroker. Still haunted by the image of an unattainable and long-lost love, he encounters a wax statue that looks exactly like her. Cushing is a pleasure to watch as always and ?? although the subject of wax museums is not new ?? This story looks fresh and innovative overall. This chapter also contains a few glorious shock moments and a constant tense atmosphere. It's a great warm-up for probably the best story: Number 3. Another legendary actor in this one, as Christopher Lee gives away an impeccable depiction of a frightened father. He is very strict and strict about his young daughter and he keeps her in isolation for the outside world. Not without reason, because the little girl shows a bizarre fascination for witchcraft and voodoo. In addition to the great portrayal of Lee and the remarkable achievement of Chloe Franks as a creepy child, this story also has a great gothic atmosphere! The devilish undertones in this story, along with the haunting sound effects of the Thunder, make this story a must for fans of authentic horror. The fourth and final story, in which a vain horror actor is controlled by his vampire cloak, is somewhat weaker than the others when it comes to suspense and credibility, but the overburdening subtle humor more or less offsets it. There is even a small space for parody in this story, as the protagonist refers to co-star Christopher Lee in the Dracula series! The most notable element in this last chapter is the presence of the gorgeous Ingrid Pitt! The cult queen from ""The Vampire Lovers"" is certainly one of the many highlights in the film - especially her cleavage. <br /> <br /> No doubt? The house, which dripped blood, is much appreciated by classic horror fans. I am firmly convinced that, with some preparations for improving the mood, this could be one of the few films that will terrify you and make a big impact. Intelligent and captivating horror as it should be! Highly recommended. An extra small remark: This film may not be repeated. CAN NOT be mistaken for ""Dorm Room That Drops Blood"". This latter one is a very irritating and lousy underground 80s Slasher who has nothing in common with this movie except the title he stole."

One nun decides she can't take the religious oppression any longer and flees the convent upset that all the leaders are male.","""Flavia, the Monaca Muslmana"" aka. 1974's ""Flavia the Heretic"" is a truly disturbing and uncompromising piece of Italian exploitation cinema, which to some extent follows a somewhat feminist premise (though the level of sleaze and brutality would probably deter the majority of feminists). The film ""Flavia the Heretic"", which mainly takes place in a convent and with a nun as lead actress (great achievement by the wonderful Florinda Bolkan), can be called a ""Nunsploitation"" movie. However, this film is very different from the typical Nunsploitation films of the time, as it does not focus so much on the nonsploitation elements as lesbianism, sadistic lesbian punishments, etc. Personally, I saw more resemblance to the hexploitation films of the time, such as ""The Sign of the Devil"" (though this does not address the subject of witch hunts), which focus on the brutal execution of Christian fundamentalism in the Middle Ages and early modern times. <br /> <br /> Italy around 1600: After Flavia witnesses her despotic father beheading a wounded Muslim soldier, she is forced to become a nun in a monastery. When her father years later condemns a co-sister to a painful death for a small offense, Falvia's loathing of male violence against women turns into hate for the despotic church, and she joins a group of Arab scavengers ... <br /> < One thing's for sure, ""Flavia the Heretic"" is not for the faint of heart, nor for those who want happy ending. Director Gianfranco Mingozzi obviously tried to make his film as realistic and disturbing as possible, especially in his nasty scenes. The many scenes of torture and execution are extremely disconcerting, with ruffians, spikes and other gruesome scenes in exact details, with the most shocking scene likely to be the young nun's torture, right at the beginning of the film. The violence here is never superfluous. After all, these cruel methods were a reality in the time the movie plays. The film is very well done, with realistic costumes, fantastic settings, an elegant cinematography and a great score by Nicola Piovani. The stunningly beautiful and magnificent Florinda Bolkan has proven her talents in many of the great Italian cult productions (including Lucio Fulci's Giallo masterpiece ""Non Si Sevizia Un Paperino"" of 1972). It's another great, charismatic show here, and I could not imagine another actress in the role as fitting as she. The film has some minor inconsistencies (eg why did the Rigid Church drop bizarre cult followers in monasteries at all). However, it is amazing how realistic this movie is. ""Flavia the Heretic"" should by no means be missed by my fans of the Italian Exploitation Cinema. This is a great exploit strip, though it is definitely deeply depressing and therefore should be viewed in the right mood. Highly recommended for fans of disturbing exploitation cinema. 7.5 / 10"

The jokes are confident and fit, and the story is well developed. The relationship between Katie and Ben feels so natural that it overshadows everything Godard has created. The all-rounder Jessica Simpson surprised once again with a strong role that only she could pull through. Simpson is really the Marilyn Monroe of our day (there is even a scene that honors her!). She balances perfectly between vulnerable and moody. Katie really shows us that you can not judge a book by its cover! Luke Wilson is as charming as ever. Even if he was covered in liquid manure, this man would be just as appealing as anyone else. His light touch, his doggy eyes and his loose manner make it difficult to resist him. Andy Dick plays the role in which he was born, one of the two evil leaders. He really can not be underestimated. The strength of the achievement lies in its restraint. It's remarkable, because most actors would just run away with it and play it cheap laugh.

The mice Jaq and Gus are the main buddies, and her own archenemy is the stepmother Lucifer's cat. Their antics are generally intertwined with the main tale and are mostly wonderful. Granted, the movie slows down slightly between the main launch of the characters and just before the stepsisters start the ball, but after this slowdown, the movie is really coming back and surprising (since ""Cinderella"" is the most worn story) of all time, probably ) ends up being one of the most involved Disney stories. <br /> <br /> The animation and art direction is nice. All of the legendary Nine Old Men animated in this image and Mary Blair's color and conceptual art (she also did conceptual art and color design for ""Alice in Wonderland"", ""Peter Pan"", ""The Three Caballeros"" and many others) make it onto the To move screen. The colors and designs are beautiful, especially in the fairy godmother and ball scenes, as well as in those pretty little moments. <br /> <br /> Overall, ""Cinderella"" is one of the best Disney fairy tales. Narratives and comes recommended too young and everything that embodies the Disney philosophy that dreams can really come true."
